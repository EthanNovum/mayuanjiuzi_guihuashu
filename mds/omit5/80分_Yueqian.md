She is especially curious about themes such a s finding a sense of belonging, the complexities of relationships with parents, and the responsibilities that come with cultural fid elity. To explore her interests more deeply, Mimi is considering various academic disciplines, including **anthropology, sociology,** **me** dia studies, and theatre. She finds herself particularly drawn to sociology and theatre, as these fields can offer valuable insights into cultural identity and interpersonal dynamics. We have gathered several resources to help her explore these disciplines. Her goal is to initiate a passion project focused on her interests this summer, which will guide her toward a more defined academic path. By the end of the summer, she **hopes** to ide **ntify** a **specific** **discipline** that resonates **with** her aspirations and passions.
