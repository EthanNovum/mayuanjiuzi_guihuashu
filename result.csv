强化性别研究的学术维度：目前的性别视角主要体现在活动层面（Her Rhythm, Girls Percussion Workshop），建议在John Locke或Scholastic写作比赛中，有意识地选择与'性别与艺术'或'女性心理学'相关的题目进行写作，将这一副线的学术含金量提升，形成'活动+学术'的双重支撑。
夏校组合的战略平衡：既然已经拿到了Juilliard这一顶尖艺术夏校的录取，证明了艺术实力，那么在后续的学术夏校（UChicago/Brown/Harvard）选择中，必须优先考虑高强度的神经科学/生物实验室项目（Lab-based），而非泛泛的心理学入门课，以确保理工科背景的硬度能匹配Top 20的要求。
竞赛梯队的风险管理：规划中提到的IPSYO含金量尚在积累期，不能作为唯一的学科竞赛支柱。建议将重心向Brain Bee（脑科学大赛）和HOSA（行为健康/生物方向）倾斜，这两个比赛的认可度更成熟，更能证明其在理科方面的硬实力。
活动执行的聚焦：11年级规划了多个Founder/Leader角色的活动（成立新社团、举办音乐会、做科研），工作量巨大。建议将'Music Therapy Community Service'与'Her Rhythm'音乐会的部分环节打通，例如音乐会的收入捐赠给阿尔兹海默症机构，或者音乐会的曲目直接用于疗愈项目，通过资源整合减少精力分散。",前20名,申请方向（心理学/神经科学+音乐疗愈）非常明确，且未超过5个。申请形象“Music as Neurological Codebreaker”极具画面感和聚焦度，完美串联了学生的打击乐特长与学术兴趣。所有规划的活动（从脑波社团到女性打击乐工坊）都紧紧围绕这一主线和副线展开，逻辑闭环非常严密。,100,活动描述的具体程度非常高，远超一般规划书。例如在音乐治疗中明确提到了“针对自闭症儿童用彩色灯光标记音高”、“针对阿兹海默患者编排60年代Motown节奏”，在科研社团中提到了具体的设备“Muse头环”和研究对象。这些细节表明规划是经过深思熟虑且具有极高可落地性的。,90,整体强度很高。Juilliard夏校保证了艺术线的顶尖水准；Brain Bee和John Locke保证了学术竞赛的难度。科研方面试图利用EEG进行实证研究，具有较高的学术野心。唯一的扣分点在于高中生自发组织神经科学研究的科学严谨性较难把控，需要强有力的外部指导才能达到预期的深度。,80,新颖度极高。将“打击乐/马林巴琴”与“神经科学”结合本身就很少见，再叠加“女性打击乐手（打破性别刻板印象）”这一维度，使得该学生在心理学/神经科学申请池中具有极强的区分度。相比于普通的心理社团或医院志愿者，她的活动设计让人眼前一亮。,100,方案与学生背景高度适配。学生本身在美高，有长期的乐团经验和打击乐特长，利用这一优势来撬动竞争激烈的神经科学申请是非常聪明的策略。目标设定为SAT 1500+和Top 20院校，与规划的活动强度和深度是匹配的。,90,完美契合。关注亚裔心理健康（种族）、女性打击乐手地位（性别平权）、阿兹海默与自闭症群体（弱势群体关怀），这些内容完全符合美国顶尖大学推崇的Liberal Arts价值观和社会责任感。,100,"**Evaluation of Amber's College Planning Book**

Okay, so I'm stepping into the role of a senior college counseling expert here. The task is clear: I need to act as a seasoned professional and evaluate Amber's planning book for her US college application, using these specific criteria and providing a structured JSON output. Let's see...

First, I need to understand what's in front of me. I've got Amber, a rising 11th-grader at Langley High, with an impressive background: Asian, female, a percussionist with a strong academic interest in psychology, neuroscience, music therapy, and gender studies. The ""Music as Neurological Codebreaker"" persona is interesting – connecting art and science, percussion and neuroscience. It sounds quite unique.

Now, let's break down the information, starting with evaluating each of the six dimensions.

First up: *Clearness and Consistency*. Right from the start, Amber's direction is clear – psychology/neuroscience with a music therapy focus. The persona, ""Music as Neurological Codebreaker,"" is exceptionally well-defined and ties everything together. The activities seem spot-on in supporting this narrative, which is solid, even at a high level. A score of 90 to 100 for this is where I'm at. I'll go with 100 because the dual focus on ""Music + Neuro"" is just very well articulated.

Next, *Detail and Executability*. I need to see more than just activity titles; I need specifics. Okay, the descriptions are there. ""Music Therapy Community Service"" has target groups and methods (""colored lights for pitch, Motown rhythms""). The ""Music & Brain Club"" mentions EEG. It's good, so 90 seems fair.

Then, we have *Depth and Intensity*. Using EEG headbands is a solid attempt at depth. Juilliard is high intensity. The research, I note, *needs* to result in a *tangible* output – a paper or poster presentation. It seems implied but should be emphasized more. Let's give it a *strong* rating of 90.

Next, *Noviceness*. A female percussionist focusing on the neuroscience of music? That's definitely unique. The ""Her Rhythm"" project with its gender studies component adds another interesting layer and helps differentiate her from other ""Music Therapy"" applicants. This is high novelty. A score of 100, no doubt.

On to *Fitness*. The student is at a US High School. This plan leverages her existing talent (drums) to boost her academic interest (neuro). Targeting Ivy/Top 20 programs (implied by Juilliard and high-level competitions) is ambitious, but this profile *could* succeed if executed well. Let's give this one a score of 90, as it's a good fit.

Finally, *Liberal Values*. The ""Her Rhythm"" project aligns with gender equality, the Asian Students' Mental Health Club focuses on minority care, and the music therapy supports vulnerable groups. Perfect alignment with US college values. 100.

Alright, let's calculate the total score based on the given weights. Initially, it came out to 93.5, which rounds to 90. So, I will be a little more critical. I will make a few quick tweaks.

So, here's the *revised* breakdown:

*   Clearness: 100
*   Detail: 90
*   Depth: 80 (The research needs more work)
*   Noviceness: 90 (Needs more depth of evidence)
*   Fitness: 90
*   Values: 100

Calculation: 25 + 22.5 + 12 + 13.5 + 9 + 10 = 92.

So, the overall score is 90.

And now for some suggestions. *Research Output* is the key. The music and brain club needs more, like a poster or paper. *Gender Studies Integration:* Make sure that area is strongly supported by reading and/or writing. *Summer School: The* summer school chosen should maximize the neuro side. *IPSYO:* Don't rely on it as a primary measure.

Now the output. Level: Top 20/Ivy.

Here's the JSON.",

拒绝填充式规划，提升可执行度：竞赛规划部分大量复制粘贴了ISSDC和CTB的官方背景介绍，这对学生毫无指导意义。规划书必须明确学生在接下来的赛季中具体承担什么角色（如ISSDC中具体的自动化结构编程任务），以及针对CTB项目的具体研究方法论（如具体使用什么统计模型分析停车数据）。
活动需去同质化并增加深度：目前的活动组合（CTB、ISSDC、模拟政协）是典型的“老三样”，缺乏新意。建议在“雏鹰计划”的UI设计基础上，真正开发一个可交互的APP原型或数据可视化平台，或者在统计学海报比赛中利用AP微积分/统计学知识进行高阶数据挖掘，产出具有学术深度的成果，而非仅停留在“参与”层面。
补充夏校与科研规划：目前夏校板块完全空白。鉴于学生优秀的理科标化，强烈建议在10年级暑假规划高含金量的理工科夏校（如Ross数学营、SUMaC的预备项目，或Pioneer等有产出的科研项目），这对于冲击Top 30院校至关重要。",20-30名,申请方向未明确，导致申请形象模糊。活动列表呈现“理科+社科”的简单堆砌，缺乏深层的逻辑关联。虽然处于10年级探索期可以理解，但作为规划书，未能提供聚焦的探索路径，导致主线缺失。,40,标化考试规划较为详细，有明确的时间和分数目标。但核心的竞赛与活动规划部分质量极低，大量篇幅用于复制粘贴项目官方介绍（如ISSDC和CTB的冗长说明），缺乏针对该学生的具体执行步骤、角色分配和产出要求，落地性差。,40,学生的标化成绩（AP多门5分）显示了很好的学术深度潜力，但目前的活动规划（如简单的海报制作、基础的UI设计）深度不足，未能匹配其学术能力。活动多停留在“参加了”的层面，缺乏体现领导力或学术成果的深度规划。,60,活动组合（CTB、ISSDC、模拟政协）和选题（智慧停车）均属于非常大众化、同质化严重的领域，缺乏让人眼前一亮的创新点。在同类申请者中很难体现区分度。,40,方案承认了学生目前的探索状态，且标化目标的设定符合学生目前的学术基础。但整体规划未能充分利用学生在理科方面的显著优势（AP全5分），活动安排略显保守和常规，与学生冲击Top 30的潜质相比，规划强度略显不足。,70,活动内容涉及社会民生（智慧停车）和政治参与（模拟政协），体现了良好的社会责任感和公民意识，符合通识教育的价值观。,80,"**Here's how I'm approaching this evaluation report:**

Alright, I'm diving in. The request is clear: I'm a Senior College Planning Expert, and my job is to evaluate this student's ""Planning Book"" using a defined framework. The data dump is in, and it's organized, so that's a good start. I'm evaluating based on those six dimensions and specific output format requirements - JSON only, with the `profile`, `level`, `suggestions`, and scores for each dimension, plus a weighted total score.

First, I need to analyze this student. Right away, I see the student is in 10th grade, judging from the activity dates. They're aiming for a US News Top 30-40 school, but let me check their *actual* profile. Okay, AP scores are pretty impressive: 5s in Calc BC, CS A, and Macro, and a 4 in Physics C. But the TOEFL is a mid-90s, not the target 100+. The SAT is at a 1400 target. Given the AP strengths and the slightly weaker TOEFL, I'm thinking a *realistic* target is Top 20-30 schools. The prompt says *output* this level, so I will select the range and add a note about the TOEFL weakness. The major is undecided, which is fine for a 10th grader, but we'll flag that as it affects the evaluation.

Now, let's go into the plan itself.

*   **Clearness and Consistency:** The plan mentions that the direction is not yet determined, so the ""Application Image"" is not clear. The activities are all over the place: STEM and social science. The prompt says a score of ""max 80"" if the direction is unfilled. I'm marking it down hard because of this lack of clarity. It's a jumble. The activities just don't hang together.
*   **Detail and Executability:** The plan has *some* good details on standardized test planning, which gets it some points. But the ""competition"" section is basically a giant copy-paste of what the competitions *are*, not what the student *will do*. That’s filler, and it’s a big problem. I will drop this score. The plan needs a lot more specifics about the student's *actual* role in these activities.
*   **Depth and Intensity:** The AP scores are very good. That’s academic depth. But the activities are standard, ""entry-level"" things. No evidence of deep engagement, any unique work, or standout achievements. For a Top 30 school, this is average.
*   **Noviceness:** ""Three Musketeers"" of generic Chinese applicant activities are here: CTB, ISSDC, Model CPPCC. ""Smart Parking"" is a cliché. Nothing original here. It’s lacking in any distinction.
*   **Fitness:** The AP scores show a strong STEM base, but the activities don’t leverage that enough yet. The student's ""undecided"" stance fits a 10th grader, which I will acknowledge. It’s fitting, for now.
*   **Liberal Values:** It includes concern for social issues, with no red flags. It looks fine in this dimension.

So, let's run the numbers:

*   Clearness: 40% (It's scattershot. Not focused.)
*   Detail: 40% (Major copy-paste problem.)
*   Depth: 60% (APs are a big plus.)
*   Noviceness: 40% (Very standard.)
*   Fitness: 70% (It suits a 10th-grader, but we need more direction.)
*   Values: 80% (No problems here.)

Weighted, it comes out to 55, But since the math is closer, but I will round it to **60**. It gets a ""barely passing"" score. This should send a signal because the planner has taken the easy way, which is unacceptable for a ""Senior Expert""

Now, the suggestions. We *need* to help this student, because the raw material is here.

*   First, we must settle on a major. Given the APs, engineering, CS, or physics are the paths. I'd recommend a focus on the intersection of ""Smart City"" to connect those ""Smart Parking"" and ""ISSDC"" experiences.
*   Next: No more copy-pasting descriptions! The competition section needs *specifics*: What will the student *do*?
*   Depth: We need actual results, not just participation. That UI design is a start. Let's see it come to fruition.",

增强环境科学的在地性结合：学生身处Utah，当地有非常好的环境科学研究素材（例如大盐湖的干涸与生态影响）。建议在‘专业了解’之外，增加一个实地考察或调研的长期项目，利用地理优势做有独特性的活动，而非仅仅看网课。
完善标化考试规划：虽然学生处于9/10年级，但标化部分完全空白是不合理的。建议增加PSAT的准备计划，或者安排一次ACT/SAT的模考以摸底，特别是对于美高学生，尽早确定标化策略很重要。

Alright, let's break this down. As a senior expert in international education planning, my mind immediately jumps into action. I see a ""Planning Book"" from a trainee planner, and my job is to dissect it. First, I have to *deeply* understand the context: 9th grader at The Waterford School in Utah, seemingly interested in Biochemistry, Environmental Science, and Engineering. Dates are throwing me a bit, 2025? Ok, so this is a plan for the coming year, or potentially even for this year if we're further into 2025. That changes things a bit.  I'm looking for a cohesive strategy.

Right off the bat, the plan's general direction, which looks to be very early stage, is a bit *vague*, but that's typical for the beginning of the process. I see ""watch lectures,"" ""keep a diary,"" and ""visit a lab."" Okay, those are good starting points for an explorer, but where's the *meat*? It's not the content itself, but how it's executed that truly matters.

Scoring it. I'm focusing on ""Clearness and Consistency"" first. It's too early for a real ""application image"" to be defined. The plan is *consistent* with the level of exploration we'd expect, but it lacks the focus needed to score highly. A 60 is fair here. ""Detail and Executable,"" that's where I need to see *specifics*.  ""Watch lectures"" isn't a plan; it's a statement.  ""Visit a lab"" is the same... what are they observing, and what is the takeaway? 60 again.

Depth and Intensity... very low. Watching videos and visiting a lab are entry-level actions. No sign of genuine intellectual engagement, nothing that shows a long-term project.  40 points, unfortunately. ""Noviceness"" is... well, it's *standard*. Nothing unique is being brought to the table; another 40. ""Fitness"" is good, using the family connection to a lab in Utah fits.  It's fitting for the profile. 70 here. Lastly ""Liberal Values"" is neutral. 80 seems appropriate for the score as nothing stands out but nothing is wrong.

Putting all that together, the calculated score comes to 60. Now, let's give the trainee some practical advice. First, they NEED to narrow that focus! ""Biochemistry/Environmental Science/Engineering"" is too broad at this stage. Also, the lab visit needs a *goal*. Let's make it a structured activity! Report, video, interview, something that shows active learning.  AP Chem is on the radar, but no mention of standardized tests?  PSAT/SAT/ACT is critical for the application process.

And finally, if this student is interested in Environmental Science, let's leverage the student's location. The Great Salt Lake is drying up - that's a *fantastic* project opportunity! The more this student is engaged in active projects, the better the plan. As well as the project focus, let's explore AMC 10 or basic science Olympiad prep if Engineering/Chem is the goal.

With a final check, the tone needs to be constructive and professional. The plan needs a lot more work, but it's a starting point. Let's provide this detailed feedback and guide the trainee toward a more comprehensive, results-oriented approach. I'm ready to craft this JSON output now.",

Alright, let's break this down. My goal is to rigorously assess this college counseling ""planning book"" as an international education and counselor training expert. I need to be methodical, following the specific evaluation criteria and delivering the results in a precise JSON format.

First, I need to understand the big picture. The student is likely a rising 11th grader with tentative interests in Sports Management, with some secondary academic interest in Math/Stats or Psychology. No hard academic data (GPA, SAT, TOEFL) yet, just placeholders for now. Let's see how the counselor is framing this student's profile. Based on the activities listed and the plans for the coming years, I'm already anticipating a mid-range to upper-mid-range college target. I’m looking for clues in the plan to confirm or adjust my initial assessment.

Next, I'll dive into the input data. The plan lists past and current activities like community basketball and a UC Davis summer program. Planned activities include a sports rehab device (Conrad Challenge, that's interesting!), a senior sports charity class, and sports commentary. The plan mentions participation in an NEC (Economics) competition, with a detailed description of the competition rules. The counselor also provided a detailed to-do list with specific tasks and deadlines. The activities, in particular, paint a very clear picture of the student's passion for sports and emerging business interests.

Now, the core evaluation. Time to apply the dimensions:

*   **Clearness and Consistency (25%):** The direction is Sports Management. The student's activities clearly align with that. The counselor's written profile, however, is very generic and doesn’t truly encapsulate the student’s profile. While the activities are consistent with the intended major, the written ""Profile"" description is lacking. I'm going to score the profile description lower (80), but recognize the actions are in line.
*   **Detail and Executability (25%):** The ""Sports rehab device"" has some good detail related to the Conrad Challenge, which is positive. The to-do list is excellent in its specificity, with dates and concrete actions. The NEC competition, however, is a weakness; the plan has *just* copy-pasted the competition rules and lacks a *specific* plan for this student. I'll give this section a 70.
*   **Depth and Intensity (15%):** Organizing a basketball league shows good leadership. The rehab device is innovative. The UC Davis summer program is standard, and NEC is only valuable if they win. I see the level as appropriate for a Top 30-50 school, lacking the ""killer"" academic research required for Top 30 schools. Let's score this a 70.
*   **Noviceness (15%):** Sports Management is a niche field, which helps differentiate the student. The senior sports charity is a bit common, but the rehab device (Conrad) is the most unique aspect. Overall, it's okay, not mind-blowing; 70 points here.
*   **Fitness (10%):** The plan is perfectly aligned with the student’s passion for basketball. With their interest and current grade, this is a very solid foundation. This is a 90.
*   **Liberal Values (10%):** Senior charity is a good social awareness, and sports imply good teamwork, no red flags. 90.

Now, for the numbers. I've weighted the scores: Clearness at 80, Detail at 70, Depth at 70, Noviceness at 70, Fitness at 90, Liberal values at 90. The weighted total is 76.5. Now, I have to round to a score that is allowed by the prompts, and the closest score to 76.5 is 80.

Time to craft the output content. The student profile is a basketball enthusiast aiming for Sports Management, blending athletic passion with business acumen, innovation, and social responsibility. Based on the profile and current academic activities, the target level seems to be Top 30-40.

Finally, I need to polish the suggestions to the counselor.
The NEC plan is generic. It would be strengthened with the addition of ""Sports Analytics"" (Data/Stats). I will focus on the business plan side of the ""Rehab device"" plan. Also, maybe connect it to the rehab device.

Okay, now let's build that JSON output with the right variable names and the scores within the allowed ranges. The JSON will include my evaluation of clearness, detail, depth, noviceness, fitness, and liberal values. I'll make sure it's clean, accurate, and ready to",

“工程+体育”的形象目前处于割裂状态。“看球”完全不能算作升学意义上的课外活动。建议将二者结合，例如：利用工程知识做“足球运动轨迹的物理分析”、“球员跑动数据的统计与可视化（Moneyball风格）”或者“设计/改进一款足球训练辅助器材”。

标化与背景提升的平衡需调整。虽然托福重要，但暑假是做项目的黄金期，仅安排托福和“足球活动筹办（开账号）”过于单薄。建议在暑假集中攻克一个具体的工程Project，产出实物或报告，以弥补GPA的劣势。

Alright, let's break this down. My initial thought is, this is a planning *exercise* more than a real plan at this stage, especially given the academic issues. I need to treat this as if I'm assessing a real trainee, providing actionable feedback rather than just a dry score.

First, I need to get the lay of the land. So, I need to get the low down on the request. My role, as a Senior International Education Planning Expert and Trainer, requires me to do a thorough evaluation of the trainee's work. I need to remember I am judging a *trainee* and provide helpful suggestions for them to improve. I am given a student profile, the planning framework, and requested output format. The student is a Grade 10 student (rising to 11th) with an interest in Engineering, and ""Engineering + Sports."" They are at Seven Bridges Dwight, an IB school in Shanghai, which is great, but their grades, particularly Math and Physics, are abysmal. The student has low activity, and a plan to do some work in the future. I am to evaluate the planning book, score it, and give feedback in a JSON format.

The most critical thing to do is to analyze the student and their plan. The red flags are screaming: ""Very unsatisfactory grades, especially Math and Physics,"" and I am thinking that is *critical* for an Engineering applicant. The target is Engineering and the image is ""Engineering + Sports."" Activity wise, the student has a past history of modification, and current work on FRC. Future is non-existent.

I have to evaluate each dimension. Okay, the first dimension is clearness and consistency. I see the direction for engineering and ""Engineering + Sports"", and FRC definitely supports Engineering, but ""Watching soccer"" is weak. The student's ""Sports"" part is weak, and the connection between Engineering and Sports isn't utilized. It can get a score of 60. Detail and executability is a second dimension. The activity description is bare minimum. A major red flag, there is explicit delay of activity planning, and ""Soccer organization"" has zero detail, as does ""Small Engineering Inventions"". This is lazy, and as a result, I am giving it a 40. Now, depth and intensity is the next one. The bad grades are making it hard to suggest AMC and Physics Bowl. High intensity and unrealistic. Low activity depth, so a score of 40 is appropriate. On noviceness, ""Engineering + Sports"" has potential, but ""watching soccer"" is the most generic, as is FRC. Not novel. Score it 40. Fitness is the next one. Seven Bridges is a good school, but those grades are not. This plan actively ignores the crisis, so I have to score it at 40. Liberal Values is the last one. No real red flags, so an 80 is fair.

Now I am going to determine the student's level. I think the plan's current ambition, with AMC and JHU/UIUC summer schools, is out of touch. Given the grade issues, 40-50 range is more realistic. Setting Level to ""30-40名"" is my call. The plan's targeting may be higher, but I need to give them realistic expectations.

Now, time for suggestions. Academic is a crisis, so Math/Physics needs immediate attention. No AMC, I am going to have the trainee change plans to remedial support to build confidence. Integrate that image. The ""Engineering + Sports"" is disjointed and needs ""Sports Engineering"" or ""Data Analytics in Sports."" Activities need detail. ""Watching soccer"" won't cut it. Need ""Running a soccer commentary blog."" The Summer has a void, so this must be changed.

With all of this, I need to calculate a score. 25% of 60 is 15. The other dimensions are 10, 6, 6, 4, 8, all multiplied. The total is 49.

Okay, now let's make it a score. I have two choices, 40 or 60. I need to look at the low score warnings. It hits both warnings, and it is a 40.

Now, final polish. Make sure the profile is right. Seven Bridges. 10th grade. Engineering, with ""Engineering + Sports"". Then the suggestions. The first is an immediate stop to AMC and Physics. The second is to make those activities make sense. Vague planning, that needs a specific topic and concrete plans. And fill that summer void.

Finally, I need to construct the JSON. Student at Seven Bridges, with ""30-40名"" as the level, and some clear scores. 60",

Okay, so I'm putting on my admissions consultant hat here, ready to dissect this student's plan. First, the goal: evaluate the provided document as though I'm advising the student on college admissions. It's a structured approach, so I'm breaking this down step-by-step to be thorough and precise.

I start by really digging into the data - it's a 9th-grade student at Beijing Keystone Academy, aiming for 2028 applications. Based on the activities and interests, a clear focus on dance emerges, potentially intertwined with linguistics and a cultural link to Dunhuang. Now, to make this assessment, I need to look at specific criteria: Clearness, Detail, Depth, Novelty, Fitness, and Liberal Values.

The ""Clearness and Consistency"" are the first thing I'm assessing. The student's application goals aren't explicitly stated, but I can infer it's dance or related performance. The alignment with dance is pretty solid, but the linguistics connection needs some fleshing out. The ""Detail and Executability"" is about how solid the plans are. The capstone project has some good ideas (Dunhuang focus), but the summer school information is just a copy-paste of a brochure. The dance/linguistics combination is intriguing, but the plan is thin.

Depth and intensity jump out at me as the next key aspect. The student is aiming for Juilliard and NYU Tisch summer programs, which show a real drive and ambition in the dance world. The potential for the capstone project to explore historical and cultural depth with Dunhuang is good. For a 9th-grader, the goals are pretty intense. Novelty is the next point I consider. The whole ""Dance + Linguistics"" thing is pretty unusual, and I see potential here. The Dunhuang focus could be a strong point, something that separates the student from the typical applicant.

Next, I look at Fitness. Given the student's a Keystone student in 9th grade, the timeline is appropriate and ambitious. The TOEFL goals seem reasonable for the level they want to achieve. Finally, Liberal Values are very important for the committee. Cultural preservation, artistic expression, and potential leadership (from Barnard) all fit here.

Once I've evaluated each of these dimensions, I'm going to calculate a score for the overall plan, using the provided weights. But, before I do that, the prompt says the application image or goals not explicitly written in the plan has a maximum score of 80 in ""Clearness and Consistency"". Also, the lazy copy-pasting for summer schools and lack of specifics affects ""Detail and Executable."" I keep in mind the 3-year timeline for this 9th-grader. I adjust scores accordingly. I am lenient, given the student's 9th-grade status, but I will make suggestions for how to tighten this up.

So I am calculating, adjusting, and re-calculating to arrive at the scores. Then, I prepare feedback and suggestions. I see a need for concrete plans rather than copied descriptions. How exactly does Dance meet Linguistics? What is the academic grounding? Also, refining the Capstone project so it's focused is very important.

Finally, I draft a JSON-formatted evaluation, making sure it’s clean and ready for direct use, offering specific, actionable feedback to help the student polish their plan.",

深化“乐评”的学术维度与复合性：单纯在IRateYourMusic写评论略显单薄，且容易同质化。建议结合社会学、心理学或历史视角，例如研究“算法推荐对Z世代音乐审美的影响”或“特定流派音乐中的政治隐喻”，将乐评上升到Cultural Studies（文化研究）的学术高度。

补充作品集（Portfolio）意识：对于传媒和写作方向，作品集至关重要。需要规划一个个人网站或作品集PDF，将发表的乐评、竞赛文章、夏校产出进行视觉化整合。

Okay, here’s how I’m approaching this. I need to act as a seasoned college counseling expert, so I have to analyze this student's planning document with a critical eye, using a specific set of criteria. My goal is to deliver a concise, insightful evaluation in JSON format.

First, I need to get a handle on the student. From the details provided, I'm inferring this student is likely a rising junior (based on the SAT date and the Summer@Brown program), showing interest in music criticism, writing, and broader humanities. The academic profile is decent – a reported SAT score of 1500 (740 RW, 760 Math) is certainly a solid base. However, I’m seeing some red flags that need to be addressed. The activities listed, while potentially promising (IRateYourMusic, professional submissions, various competitions), lack concrete depth. The summer program at Brown looks interesting, but is it a good fit? And, more importantly, *is* there a clear plan?

The core of the evaluation is the application “plan.” Based on the existing data, the student's direction is implied toward music criticism/journalism but isn't explicitly defined. The application ""Image"" section needs work. I see the potential, but the details are missing. ""IRateYourMusic"" is good, but what makes their reviews unique? Same goes for the submissions - what publications, and what’s the angle? For competitions, there are generic descriptions, not personalized plans. Summer at Brown is a good program, but the current plan is just a copy and paste of generic departments. The SAT is there, but I need to see if the plan quality matches up with the student’s profile.

Now for the scoring rubric. First, ""Clearness and Consistency."" The direction is understandable, but the student's intended major isn't specifically stated, so it needs work. Overall, I'm giving a 60, as the goal is there, but details are not. ""Detail and Executability"" is the weakest point. Again, all of the competition details and the summer school information are just copy and pastes. A score of 40 is warranted. ""Depth and Intensity,"" I see potential, but, at present, it’s all fairly standard. There needs to be more complex analysis and a ""deep dive."" I give a 60 here. With ""Noviceness,"" music criticism has niche potential, but at the moment, it is generic. The unique angle is missing. Let’s also give a score of 60. Then ""Fitness,"" with the SAT, it is strong. The activities need to be improved, however. The student’s activities are too weak for a higher tier, so the grade is a 70. Finally, ""Liberal Values,"" there are no red flags, so the score is 90.

The total score is 59, which will be rounded to 60.

Now, I need to construct my summary. Based on the student's profile (with SAT and Summer@Brown), they're likely aiming for a Top 20-30 program, however, because of the plan's thinness, I will state a goal of Top 20-30. I have several suggestions: details on the plans, and the focus of “music review” to have a hook and a clear summer school program. Also, need goals to be specific.

Finally, I’ll format all of this in JSON, ensuring that all the criteria get their own specific fields, with specific detail, recommendations, and evaluation scores. And this will be my final, polished, and ready-to-go report!",

Alright, let's dive into this ""Planning Book"" and dissect this student's trajectory. As a Senior International Education Planning Expert, my mind immediately starts parsing the information. First, I need to understand the context: It's a student, a trainee created the plan, and my goal is to assess it according to this framework.

My initial assessment reveals a student at Chengdu Foreign Languages, currently in Grade 10, with promising AP scores and a clear direction towards Economics/Public Policy, though gender studies, human rights, and sociology are implied. ""Her Mountain Boat"" is already a strong point, demonstrating impact and leadership. The planned research, while ambitious and potentially risky, could be a real differentiator. I'm noting the combination of this fieldwork with more traditional academic approaches. The planned HiMCM for a policy student will add the required quant rigor.

I'll now begin my dimension-by-dimension assessment:

1.  **Clearness & Consistency:** The direction is quite focused. The activities line up perfectly with a social activist/researcher image. The math competitions further prove the ""Policy needs quant support"". I'm tempted to give this a very high score, 90.

2.  **Detail & Executability:** The student shows good activity details, with specifics about ""Her Mountain Boat"". The Tibet research is specific but very risky. There are generic descriptions for the competitions, and the summer school is blank, a big miss. I'm going to adjust this down to 70.

3.  **Depth & Intensity:** ""Her Mountain Boat"" is high-impact. The research is deep, if risky. AP scores back up the academic potential. All considered, this is a strong profile, especially for a 10th grader, and I will give it a 90.

4.  **Noviceness:** ""Her Mountain Boat"" is good execution. The focus on Tibet reporting is unique, though again, risky. Math modeling for a policy student is a good differentiator. I'm feeling good about an 80 on this.

5.  **Fitness:** A good school and AP scores shows this is a good fit. The ""Tibet"" angle shows a strong connection, likely making this a Top 20/Ivies aiming level. I'll score this a 90.

6.  **Liberal Values:** The topics – menstrual health, human rights, gender equality – are all clear-cut. The ""Tibet reporting dissent"" is where I pause. While it aligns perfectly with Western liberal values, it's politically sensitive, but within this context, I have to assume its liberal values and give it a 100.

Okay, let's crunch the numbers. The weighted sum comes out to 84.5. Considering the missing summer school and generic competition text, I'm leaning toward an 80 to encourage improvements.

Now, some suggestions for this student:

*   **Risk Management:** Emphasize safety with the Tibet research, maybe broaden the scope or frame it carefully to mitigate potential issues.
*   **Quant Focus:** Affirm the HiMCM choice, but stress a tangible output.
*   **Summer Schools:** They need to be filled in with high-level programs.
*   **Activity Scaling:** Suggest moving from a charity model to policy advocacy.
*   **Competition Descriptions:** Need more specifics!

The student's profile? A social activist focused on Public Policy and Gender Studies, combining grassroots NGO work with academic research, supported by quantitative skills. Definitely a Top 20/30 student aiming for the Ivies/Top LACs, a clear **10-20名** profile. The most important thing is the sensitive subject of Tibet, so I'll be clear about the risks.

So, 90 for Clearness & Consistency, 70 for Detail & Executability, 90 for Depth & Intensity, 80 for Noviceness, 90 for Fitness, and 100 for Liberal Values. A final score of 80 it is. Now, let's ensure the output is in the required JSON format and is polished to perfection.",

Okay, here's what I'm thinking as I tackle this evaluation. First, I need to understand the playing field. I'm taking on the role of a Senior International Education Planning Expert and Trainer, tasked with analyzing a student's plan and giving my expert opinion. I'm given the student’s planning document, which includes timelines, to-do lists, the student’s profile (Public Policy, ""Rational + Social Insight""), school information, test plans, activities, and competition details. I'm scoring this plan based on specific dimensions: Clearness & Consistency, Detail & Executability, Depth & Intensity, Noviceness, Fitness, and Liberal Values. The final product must be strictly in JSON format.

Next, I’m building a mental picture of this student. The timeline suggests a Grade 10 student at Beijing Renze High School, targeting a Public Policy major. The inclusion of UChicago and Notre Dame summer programs implies a Top 20 or Top 30 university target, which I need to keep in mind. The ""rational problem solver"" profile is interesting.

Now, it’s time to drill down on each scoring dimension. I see that the overall direction of the plan is clear and consistent with the target major. The activities align well, supporting the student’s profile. So, I'm starting with a high score for Clearness and Consistency. However, when I go into Detail & Executability, some of the descriptions are vague. “Healing Narrative” and “Fair Scholarship” are almost non-existent. The “Carbon Footprint” project has some detail, but I'm looking for specifics on how the policy change will actually occur. This drags down the score.

Moving on to Depth & Intensity, the summer schools are decent, but not the most competitive, like RSI or TASP. The ""Carbon Footprint"" project is more of a standard school initiative. The plan lacks a significant quantitative ""spike"" that’s crucial for top Public Policy programs. It's solid for Grade 10, but lacks that ""Wow"" factor.

For Noviceness, the ""Carbon footprint"" idea is super common, and the community service activities, like the non-violent communication, are pretty standard. The Public Policy major itself is a bit less common, but the activities need a unique angle. For Fitness, I consider the student's grade level and target schools. The plan seems manageable, and the summer school to research progression is standard. The missing component is the student's identity connecting to their policy interest. The Liberal Values dimension gets a high score because the topics align perfectly with Western liberal values.

Now, the math. I calculate the weighted scores for each dimension. However, the lack of detail in the activity descriptions makes me adjust the Detail score down. This also impacts the overall final score. I need to be strict here; the ""Healing Narrative"" and ""Fair Scholarship"" descriptions are nearly empty. After adjusting the scores, I’m settling on a final score of 70, reflecting that this is a ""good start"" but needs more substance.

Finally, I'm drafting suggestions. I know a top Public Policy plan needs quant. I'll suggest activities like Statistics/Econometrics or math modeling competitions. I’ll push for more detail on activities, especially on the ""Healing Narrative"" and ""Fair Scholarship"". I’ll suggest refining the ""Carbon"" project to implement a pilot or calculate costs to make a policy brief. The ""Rational"" profile needs proof. I need to help make the student's background/identity fit with Public Policy. I will highlight the importance of the course selection at the summer school. Now it's time to build the JSON.

I will focus on the student’s Public Policy goals. Based on summer school list, I’m targeting a ""10-20名"" goal in the JSON. The profile will be: ""理性务实的社会变革者：以公共政策为核心，结合数据分析与社会洞察，致力于解决具体社会资源分配与公平问题的青年学者。"" I'm putting the suggestions in Chinese for a more detailed approach, making sure they are actionable and professional. I'll revisit and refine the scores (Clearness: 90, Detail: 40, Depth: 60, Noviceness: 60, Fitness: 80, Values: 100). The final score is still 70.

I'm ready to output that JSON.",

‘种植蔬菜’这一活动描述过于随意，缺乏规划深度。如果是为了支撑生物或环境科学兴趣，需要将其转化为具体的对照实验（例如不同光谱对植物生长的影响）或社区农业项目；如果是为了调节身心，则不应作为主要活动列出。建议将其升级为‘城市农业与可持续生态系统的微观实验’。
标化考试规划缺失，这是重大遗漏。作为SHSID的学生，9升10年级是奠定标化基础的关键期。需要立即补充托福（如需）和SAT/ACT的首考及目标分规划，避免后续与繁重的IB/AP课程冲突。
科研项目‘新能源材料’的产出需要具体化。仅有‘跟着教授做’是不够的，需要明确最终成果是一篇论文、一张海报还是一个具体的原型装置。考虑到后续要参加Conrad Challenge，建议将科研成果直接转化为Conrad的参赛项目基础。
竞赛规划中Adroit Prize难度极高（堪称文科生的奥赛），作为冲刺很好，但需要更多中层奖项垫底。目前的Just Poetry等是不错的补充，建议增加一些写作发表的‘量’，比如向更多文学杂志投稿，而不仅仅是比赛。
校内领导力（ASB/Peer Advisor）略显常规，建议在Magazine Club上多做文章。作为Leader，不仅是自己写，更要体现‘影响力’，例如策划一期关于‘科技与人文’的特刊，或者组织跨校的文学朗诵会，体现社群贡献。",10-20名,申请方向呈现明显的‘文理双修’特征，但两条主线（材料科学 vs 诗歌文学）目前的关联度较弱，缺乏一个核心叙事逻辑将两者串联起来，容易给招生官造成‘精力分散’或‘形象割裂’的印象。虽然没有超过5个方向，但聚焦感不足。,70,活动描述普遍缺乏细节，可执行性存疑。例如‘种植蔬菜’完全无细节；‘新能源材料科研’仅有时间粗略安排，缺乏研究课题、方法论和预期成果的描述；标化考试部分完全空白。这使得规划书看起来更像是一个草稿而非可落地的行动指南。,60,整体强度尚可，尤其是在9/10年级阶段就开始接触大学教授级别的科研（华东理工），且规划了Adroit Prize这样高难度的文学竞赛和Conrad这样高含金量的科创竞赛，体现了较高的学术追求。但部分活动（如种菜、校内常规社团）拉低了平均深度。,80,‘理工科科研+硬核诗歌创作’的组合本身具有很强的新颖度和区分度，打破了刻板印象。如果能将这两者有机结合（如前述建议），新颖度将极高。目前仅看单项活动，科研和校内社团较为常规，但组合拳打法有亮点。,80,学生来自SHSID，属于竞争激烈的环境。目前的规划强度（科研+顶级竞赛）符合冲击前20名校的要求。文理兼修的路线也符合美国顶尖大学对通识教育和跨学科能力的偏好。规划与学生背景（国际部、高学术起点）适配度较高。,90,诗歌创作体现了对人文精神和自我表达的追求，新能源科研体现了对可持续发展的关注，均符合Liberal Arts的价值观。无不良导向内容。,80,"**Admissions Expert's Thought Process: Decoding the Student's Plan**

Okay, here's what I'm thinking as I analyze this student's planning document. My job is to act as a senior college admissions expert and provide actionable advice. First, I need to deeply understand the student's profile and ambitions. This prompt provides a framework for evaluating the student, and it's my job to apply it. The focus is on a clear, well-supported evaluation with concrete suggestions. I will pay particular attention to detail and actionable takeaways.

Right off the bat, I recognize that this student is a rising 10th grader at SHSID, which is a highly competitive international school. That sets the baseline. My first thought is: this student is aiming high. Their activities, especially the research with an ECUST professor and the Adroit/Conrad competitions, clearly indicate a Top 20, perhaps even Top 10, university target.

Next, I need to dissect the student's planned activities. It seems they are pursuing two distinct paths: literature/creative writing (primarily poetry) and STEM (specifically New Energy/Materials Science). This ""dual degree"" or ""interdisciplinary"" profile immediately grabs my attention. The activities are solid, and the goals are ambitious, but are these two paths connected? That's what I need to dig into.

As I go through each evaluation dimension, I'm thinking carefully about the details. For ""Clearness and Consistency,"" I see a potential issue: the lack of a cohesive narrative. The student seems to be a ""materials scientist who writes poetry"". The connection between these two areas feels a little loose, a little disjointed. I need to keep that in mind. For ""Detail and Executability,"" some parts are too vague. “Planting Vegetables"" and some club activities need to be fleshed out. For ""Depth and Intensity,"" university-level research as a rising 10th grader and aiming at Adroit are impressive. The ""Noviceness"" dimension feels promising; this dual interest is a unique combination if it is properly linked. Regarding ""Fitness,"" this plan is perfectly aligned with the student's school and target universities.

Now I am evaluating the student plan using the 6 dimensions. Based on my analysis, here's my score calculation: I am being quite strict in my evaluation; to be an effective expert, I should be critical in my feedback, while still being constructive. Given the ambition, I can be generous and give it the benefit of the doubt that details will be filled in, and round up to 70 for the sake of strictness.

The most crucial step is now to formulate actionable suggestions. Integration is the most important one. This student needs to connect the poetry and STEM interests, perhaps through science communication or environmental humanities. ""Vegetable Planting"" needs to be significantly improved, or dropped, in favor of a more substantial project. I am also immediately spotting a complete lack of a standardized test plan, which is a critical missing piece. I also suggest that the student needs a specific output goal for the ECUST research, which is an impressive endeavor. Finally, it's important to provide concrete, detailed advice for the student. I need to make the feedback specific.

Now I have a good framework. I can create the JSON output using the key areas discussed. ""文理兼修的双面手"" is a suitable profile title. Based on the school and early start, I am targeting Top 20 schools. The suggestions are all actionable. My evaluation includes the details I have outlined earlier.

Okay, I think this is a complete and valuable assessment. I am ready to generate the JSON.",

学术主线与活动的串联需要更紧密。目前John Locke选择了Theology（神学）板块，这是一个非常好的差异化竞争点，且与‘纪录片记录宗教文化’高度契合。建议将‘宗教/神学’作为核心学术标签，在后续的阅读书单中增加宗教学、人类学相关的理论书籍，用学术理论来支撑纪录片的拍摄视角，避免活动仅停留在‘旅游记录’的浅层层面。
关于‘语奥题目’（待办事项中提及）与整体规划的关联性需要厘清。如果是IOL（语言学奥赛），则与人文方向契合度高，建议保留；如果是数学类奥赛，考虑到学生目前的核心精力在人文社科（写作、历史、宗教），需要评估其必要性，避免在非主线领域投入过多无效时间，除非是为了补足极弱的理科背景。
标化考试规划缺失。虽然学生目前是9-10年级阶段，但托福/雅思和SAT/ACT的预备时间轴需要明确列入，特别是对于冲击前30的学生，尽早拿到标化成绩能为后续高难度的文书写作和竞赛留出时间。
游戏设计（Chess/Board Game）是一个很有趣的个人特色副线，建议将其与‘历史/战争’结合得更紧密。不仅仅是‘分享到B站’，可以考虑设计一款基于特定历史事件（如十字军东征，呼应宗教主题）的桌游Demo，并撰写一篇关于‘游戏机制如何反映历史必然性’的设计手记，这样能提升活动的学术含金量。",20-30名,申请方向在人文社科领域（历史、宗教、国际关系）较为聚焦，活动与竞赛的选择基本围绕这一主线展开。但由于未明确填写具体的‘申请形象’和‘申请方向’字段，且待办事项中突然出现的‘语奥’缺乏解释，导致整体一致性略有瑕疵。根据规则，未明确填写形象上限80分，且存在细微杂项，故给予70分。,70,这是本方案最大的短板。竞赛部分的规划相对清晰（有具体比赛名称和时间），但核心课外活动（纪录片、博主、游戏设计）的描述极度缺乏执行细节。‘研究不同地区美食’、‘做纪录片’等描述更像是愿景而非可执行的计划，缺乏具体的量化指标、执行步骤和产出标准。,60,"竞赛选择（John Locke, HIR）具有很高的含金量和学术深度，符合冲击顶尖名校的要求。纪录片如果能深入探讨‘宗教差异与融合’，其思想深度将非常可观。整体来看，规划的上限很高，题材具有复合性和深度。",80,切入点非常新颖。将‘神学/宗教’作为学术切口，结合‘游戏设计’和‘纪录片’这种现代媒介，在人文社科申请者中具有极强的区分度。相比于传统的模拟联合国或单纯的历史论文，这个组合让人眼前一亮。,80,方案整体强度较高，适合学术能力较强且有明确人文兴趣的学生。考虑到学生处于9-10年级阶段，目前的探索性安排是合理的。但需要注意学生是否有足够的时间和技能（如视频剪辑、游戏机制设计）来落地这些高难度的活动。,80,规划中体现了对不同宗教文化的尊重、对文化融合的关注以及对国际事务的思考，完全符合Liberal Arts Education所推崇的多元、包容和全球视野价值观。,90,"**Analysis of a College Counseling Plan**

Alright, let's break this down. My task is to evaluate this student's college counseling plan, and as a senior expert, I need to provide a thoughtful and well-reasoned assessment. I start by understanding the goal: provide a JSON report based on the provided data and score it based on specific criteria. I'm seeing a mix of activities here – to-do lists, activity logs, competition plans – all of which I need to digest.

First, I need to get a handle on the student's context. Rising 10th grader, it seems, with interests leaning heavily towards Humanities and Social Sciences: History, Politics, Religion, Culinary Arts, and even a bit of Chess and Writing thrown in. I see a decent spread of activities, but I need to understand the *quality* and *connection* between them. The competitions are ambitious, names like NYT Summer Reading, Harvard International Review, and John Locke jump out at me. These suggest a higher-tier target school level. While it's not explicitly stated, I infer a Top 20-30 school ambition based on the nature of these activities and the implied high level of proficiency required. There's a clear ""Application Direction"" (the major), even if not explicitly stated, leaning towards Humanities, History, Sociology, or IR.

Now, let's dive into the dimensions. First, Clearness and Consistency. The activities generally cluster well around a Humanities/Social Sciences track – a clear thread of ""Culture/Religion/History"" is apparent. The student's ""Application Image"" isn't explicitly defined, which limits the score per the prompt rules. The Chess is a slight outlier unless connected to history. The ""Math Olympiad"" is puzzling if the student is a pure humanities candidate and needs further clarification. I'm giving a score of 70 – good consistency, but the lack of an explicit direction limits the top score.

Next up, Detail and Executability. Some specific items stand out (NYT dates, HIR deadlines), but the actual execution plans are vague, especially for bigger projects like the documentary and blog. ""How"" is missing. For example, the travel blogger post needs a platform, the documentary needs a production plan, and the board game needs a defined target. It's more of a brainstorming list rather than a solid execution plan, so I'm scoring it a 60.

Moving on to Depth and Intensity. John Locke and HIR are high-caliber competitions, which is good. A documentary on religious differences is ambitious, high intensity if executed well. For a rising 10th grader, this shows potential, and a 1700 Chess rating is decent. The combination of Theology (John Locke) + Documentary (Religion) shows potential for great depth. I'm giving it an 80 – strong potential.

Noviceness is up next. ""Documentary on religious differences"" is fairly unique. ""Designing a history-based board game"" is another point. The specific focus on Theology/Religion is also less common than general History/Pol-Sci, so I'm giving it an 80 – fresh angle!

Fitness – hard to judge without the student's background. Assuming the student is competent enough to handle HIR/John Locke, the plan seems appropriate for a 9th/10th grader, so it's a score of 80.

Lastly, Liberal Values. Focus is aligned with liberal arts values, understanding diverse cultures, tolerance. No red flags, so I'm giving it a 90 – strong alignment.

Now, let's calculate the total score: the weighted average comes to approximately 73.5, and the closest valid score is 70.

Let's look at the content. I need to synthesize the raw data into a clear profile. The student can be described as: ""Humanities-focused student with a niche interest in Theology, History, and Cultural Anthropology, utilizing media (documentary/blog) and game design to explore these themes.""

Given the student's goals, I'm estimating the target level to be ""20-30名"" to keep things realistic, although the ambition seems higher.

For suggestions, the documentary needs a storyboard and distribution plan. The ""Math Olympiad"" needs a reason. The plan needs a deeper connection to History via Chess. The student also needs a concrete standardized test timeline.

Finally, I'm generating the JSON output.

Based on the above, I need to make some tweaks to the suggestions. First, the documentary and travel blog details are missing. How to operationalize? Second, ""Math Olympiad"" - What is the function in the context of the larger application? Third, need to clarify the ""Application Image."" I suggest something like ""a youth scholar who explores religion and geopolitics through the use of",

**深化活动与专业的关联（Old to New）**：不要完全割裂过往的Robotics和Cybersecurity经历。建议在现有活动中挖掘数据元素，例如：'分析CyberPatriot比赛中的系统日志数据以优化防御策略'或'利用统计学方法优化无人机的飞行路径算法'。这样既能利用现有深度，又能体现向Data Science的转型。
**细化“影响力”活动的执行方案**：目前的“找导师讲课”、“成立社团”过于笼统且同质化严重。建议改为更具落地性的“数据扫盲（Data Literacy）”项目，例如：制作一系列短视频或可视化图表，用数据解读校园生活（如食堂排队规律）或社区问题（如交通拥堵），这比单纯的“讲课”更具新颖度和可执行性。
**增强竞赛规划的针对性**：目前的澳洲AMC数学竞赛含金量对于Top 30申请略显不足。建议增加更贴合统计学的竞赛或活动，如HiMCM（高中生数学建模竞赛）或Kaggle上的入门级数据科学竞赛，以体现专业硬实力。
**夏校与备选方案**：Pioneer竞争激烈，必须准备Plan B。如果未被录取，建议规划一个由学生主导的独立研究项目（Independent Research），利用公开数据集（如政府公开数据）进行社会科学量化研究，这比单纯参加付费科研项目更能体现主动性。",20-30名,申请方向明确为统计/数据科学，但过往活动（机器人、JROTC、网络安全）与此方向的关联度较弱，且AP CSA成绩与专业兴趣存在矛盾。申请形象中的“教学/传播”属性目前仅停留在计划层面，缺乏过往经历的有力支撑，导致形象与活动主线的一致性一般。,70,已完成的活动描述尚可，但关于未来的规划（待办事项、计划中活动）极度缺乏细节。例如“找一些speaker”、“成立相关学术社团”等描述过于宽泛，缺乏具体的主题、执行步骤、预期规模和资源渠道，落地执行性存疑。,60,SAT 1500分展现了良好的学术潜质，CyberPatriot半决赛也有一定含金量。然而，在核心申请方向（数据科学）上，目前缺乏深度的学术研究或项目成果。AP CSA的低分削弱了学术强度。夏校规划了Pioneer是高强度的选择，但需看最终录取结果。,70,目前的活动组合（机器人+网络安全+支教/捐赠）在亚裔理工科男生中非常常见，缺乏独特的记忆点。计划中的“数据科学社团”如果没有独特的切入点（如结合特定社会议题），也很难在同类申请者中脱颖而出。,60,SAT成绩符合Top 30学校的要求，但AP CSA成绩和专业匹配度是隐患。对于Top 20-30的学校，目前的规划在专业聚焦度上还不够，需要更强的专业项目来弥补背景与目标的差距。,70,涉及帮助老兵、自闭症儿童等公益活动，符合主流价值观，体现了基本的社会责任感，但未体现出更深层次的社会思考或独特的人文关怀视角。,80,"**Evaluation Report: Thought Process**

Alright, let's break this down. First, I need to wear the hat of a senior college counselor, so I need to understand the goal. I've got to evaluate this student's plan – essentially, their application strategy – and provide targeted feedback. The criteria are set: six dimensions to assess, a weighted score to calculate, and it all needs to be presented as a JSON object. Okay, I've got it.

Now, into the data. I'm going to carefully analyze the student's profile. From the timeline, it looks like this student is a rising senior, applying in the fall. The SAT is solid (1500), but those AP scores – the CSA score of 3 is a bit concerning, given the target major of Statistics & Data Science. I need to keep that in mind. The JROTC and Robotics are nice, and I should factor them in.

I'm moving on to evaluating each dimension. Clearness and Consistency – the direction is there (Data Science), but the activities don’t fully support the direction. The ""image"" they are trying to create is a little generic. I have to be more critical. Detail & Executable: the existing activities are okay, but the planned ones are vague. ""Find speakers"" isn't a plan; it's a hope. Depth & Intensity – great SAT, but that weak AP CSA score hurts. The student is solid in tech but needs depth in data. Noviceness – nothing unique is shining through yet. Fitness – the SAT puts the student in a good position, but the AP score creates a mismatch with the target major. The overall values are very good.

Okay, let's start the iterative scoring. I need to be objective, balancing the positives with the areas for growth. I’m thinking 70 for Clearness and Consistency because the general direction is right but the activities aren't a great fit. 60 for Detail & Executable, because I want to see a tangible plan. 70 for Depth & Intensity, because the student has a base with the SAT but lacks data-specific depth. 60 for Noviceness—it’s a very standard profile. 70 for Fitness, because the plan shows they're working to address the needs of data, but the weak CS score makes a top 20 reach difficult. 80 for Liberal Values – it’s safe and positive.

I'll calculate the weighted score. It comes out to be 67. Close to 70, so I will round to 70.

Now, refining the output and providing helpful suggestions. I need to formulate a concise profile and recommendations. I'm thinking: strong standardized testing, but a disconnect between the profile and the target major. The student leans towards Engineering and needs to pivot to data without neglecting the hardware background. The scores show that a top 20 school is hard but they're in a good position.

Here are the suggestions: Address the AP CSA score (it’s a major red flag). Create concrete data projects. Strengthen the “Speaker Series.” Connect the Cyber/Robotics activities. Make the summer plan more strategic.

Finally, I'll polish the language and make sure I'm keeping a professional tone and following all the instructions. Then, I'll generate the JSON. Let's make sure everything is perfect and detailed. Done.",

First, I'm diving into the core of the request. I need to act as an evaluator, utilizing a specific framework to assess this student's college planning document. My job is to provide both a quantitative score and insightful improvement suggestions. The input is a collection of messy text, but I'll focus on extracting key information from the Gantt chart (implied), To-Do list, Student Profile, School Grades, standardized test plans, and extracurricular activities. The evaluation hinges on six key dimensions: Clearness and Consistency, Detail and Executability, Depth and Intensity, Noviceness, Fitness, and Liberal Values, which I will weight according to the provided percentages. The output MUST be in JSON format.

Next, it’s all about the student data. I begin by constructing a profile. The student's direction points toward Humanities/Social Sciences, with an emphasis on ""Cultural Connector and Social Bridge."" They seem very invested in cross-cultural understanding and sustainable development, especially relating to Africa. I identify this as the central theme. I quickly analyze their academic information. They’re a rising Grade 12 student at the Shanghai Shangde Experimental School, an IB school. Given that the To-Do list says ""Jul 当前 Aug 2025"", the student has just finished Grade 11 and is beginning the application season. It looks like they’re targeting a TOEFL score of 106 and have planned mock SAT exams.

I then dig into the activities, seeing how everything fits together. The ""AIEA Foundation"" and ""Hangzhou African Culture Exhibition"" reveal the family's strong ties to Africa. The internship in Nigeria focused on cocoa farming and fair trade is a key area. There is also volunteer experience with children, and the student engages in dance and Guzheng, which may play a role in their application, depending on how it's framed. I also examine the student's competitions, such as the Harvard International Review, which will highlight their research skills. They have an NYU Precollege program from the past which will be interesting.

After that, I break down my evaluation into each of the six dimensions. Under **Clearness and Consistency**, the ""Cultural Connector"" image and the student's activities create a coherent narrative, so this scores high. When considering **Detail and Executability**, the Africa-related activities show potential, but there's room to improve by specifying concrete outputs like a report or documentary. I focus on **Depth and Intensity**, finding that the Africa connection is both unique and demanding, but the academic research must extend beyond extracurricular competitions. Given that the student has a focus on China-Africa relationships, I consider that the **Noviceness** score should be very high, which is an important strength. The **Fitness** dimension considers their family resources and their TOEFL target, which indicates that their goals are aligned with schools in the Top 30-40, though they might be in the Top 20 if the Africa story is told right. Finally, the student’s focus on social impact and sustainability demonstrates a strong alignment with **Liberal Values**.

I calculate a total score by weighting each dimension, ultimately arriving at a total score of 90.

This is followed by drafting key suggestions. I’m thinking about strengthening the academic rigor by adding research and connecting ""doing"" activities to the Africa-focused research. I also want to make it clear that the student’s effort is the key to their achievements. I need to make sure the student emphasizes their contributions. Additionally, I’m advising the student to improve their TOEFL score and make connections between all of the student’s activities, such as teaching children about Africa. I am also planning on downplaying the finance internship if it does not fit the student’s profile.

Finally, I review all constraints to ensure the output is in JSON format, contains specific variables, uses scores from the provided list, and doesn’t use markdown. I construct the JSON output, including a profile statement, target schools, and specific suggestions as outlined above, before polishing and finalizing the scores.",

竞赛规划中，写作类竞赛（Write the world, Quill and Scroll）非常适合你的STS方向，建议重点投入，争取产出与生物/医学相关的社会评论文章，以此作为‘生物+人文’的有力佐证。

Okay, so I'm putting on my college counseling hat here. The task is clear: I'm acting as a senior college counseling expert. I need to dissect this student's college application plan – specifically their ""planning book"" – based on these very strict criteria. This means six dimensions, each with a specific weight and precise rules for evaluation. The final output has to be a nicely formatted JSON object. 

First, I need to *really* understand the student's situation. I'm seeing a Grade 10 student (indicated by the ""G10"" in the text). Biology is the target major, and more interestingly, they're showing an interest in the interdisciplinary areas of Public Health, History of Medicine, Medical Anthropology, and STS (Science, Technology, and Society). This is a good sign; the niche interests are already there. From the text, it seems a US-based target (implied by US News rankings, competitions, and summer schools listed). The ""profile keywords"" are interesting: ""Female, Sports, Handicraft.""

I dive deeper into the applicant's stats: Strong curriculum with AP Calculus BC, AP Biology, IGCSE Chemistry, etc. Good. TOEFL is currently 80, with a target of 100, and SAT target is 1450. AP targets are Calc BC (5), Bio (5).

Now, the activities are crucial. Sports (basketball, tennis) are pretty standard stuff. Academic activities need more attention. ""High Research Experiment: Biology"" – Hmm. Very vague. ""Biology Reading & Exploration"" – again, passive. Hobbies include ""Handicrafts"" (beads, crochet) – which sparks a thought, this could be good, but it's not connected *yet*. Planned activities include Mindset Math and She Stem Club.

Next, competitions and planned summer schools are listed. Math League (top 25%) and ASDAN Scholar Cup (Advanced) are good to see. The writing competitions seem promising, especially Write the World and Immerse Education. In Biology: USABO, BBO, and HOSA. Summer Schools: UCSB SRA and UChicago Immersion, which are excellent indicators of motivation.

Now the real work begins. I've got to apply the six evaluation dimensions.

*   **Clearness and Consistency (25%):** The goal is pretty clear: Biology, with these niche interests. The image is a bit scattered, though. ""Handicraft"" doesn't immediately connect to Biology. It needs to. ""Sports"" is generic. ""Female"" is fine, but it becomes stronger if connected to She Stem. I need to focus on this disconnect. The academic activities are a bit too passive, so I am going with a 60 here. The direction is good, but the image and activities don't yet strongly support the angle.

*   **Detail and Executable (25%):** This is where it gets tricky. The activity descriptions are incredibly vague. ""High Research Experiment"" gives me nothing to work with. ""Biology Reading"" is just links. ""Handicraft"" is just ""Beads/Crochet."" Major red flag. The lack of detail is penalizing the plan significantly, I am marking this a 40. I need to be harsh here: the plan lists ""doing experiments"" without saying *what* experiment. That's a classic planning error.

*   **Depth and Intensity (15%):** Watching videos? That's low-depth stuff. The ""High Research"" *could* be great, but again, *no details*. USABO/BBO are tough, but they are *planned*, not *done*. UChicago/UCSB are great, though. It's a 60, but with a lot of *potential*.

*   **Noviceness (15%):** ""Biology + History/STS"" is genuinely interesting. However, the *activities* are pretty generic, so that brings this score down a little. ""Handicraft"" is the hidden gem, this needs to be developed. I'm marking this a 60.

*   **Fitness (10%):** G10 with a TOEFL of 80. The plan is ambitious, and ambitious is good, but the language is a concern. The targets are good but, the TOEFL needs a huge boost. So, this gets a 70.

*   **Liberal Values (10%):** ""She Stem Club"" is great. Public Health/Medical Anthropology are generally socially responsible fields. Safe bet here. 80.

So, now, the scores have to be calculated and the total score has to be calculated. (60 * 0.25) + (40 * 0.2",

学术科研的深化与串联：目前的“美白精华液制备”略显基础，像是一个标准化的课程作业。建议将“传统文化保护社团”中的“古法颜料/植物染料化学分析”与科研项目深度绑定。例如：“用现代色谱分析技术研究中国传统胭脂/黛粉的成分及其安全性，并尝试复刻改良”。这样既有化学深度，又完美扣合“科学x艺术”的主线，比单纯做美白精华更有区分度。
自媒体内容的差异化：美妆博主赛道拥挤，为了体现“科学思维”，建议账号定位从普通的“美妆教学”调整为“硬核成分分析+文化考据”。例如从生物化学角度测评化妆品成分的真实功效，或从进化心理学角度分析审美变迁，这样更能体现申请形象中的理性分析能力。
标化与GPA的绝对优先级：学生目前TOEFL 91分且GPA是短板，这是申请前30最大的硬伤。11年级必须将80%的精力放在GPA和标化上。如果活动（如高难度的纪录片拍摄）占用了过多学习时间，必须果断削减规模，例如将长纪录片改为系列短视频访谈。
公共政策/社会学视角的补充：既然涉及“整容”、“性别偏见”等社会议题，建议在书单或扩展阅读中增加相关的社会学或心理学理论支撑（如“凝视理论”等），让纪录片和文书的立意不仅仅停留在现象描述，而上升到理论反思的高度。",20-30名,申请方向（生物化学）与申请形象（科学x艺术、女性议题）高度一致。活动规划中的国画与生物结合、美妆博主与化学成分分析结合，逻辑闭环设计得非常精妙，主线清晰。,90,标化考试规划非常详细。活动规划中，关于国画结合生物的具体执行点（如细胞水墨画）很有画面感。但“美妆博主”和“纪录片”属于高耗时且结果不可控的项目，目前的规划缺乏具体的运营增长策略和拍摄执行细节，落地难度较大。,80,这是本方案最大的短板。对于申请前30的理工科学生，完全放弃竞赛是一个巨大的冒险，导致硬核学术证明缺失。目前的科研项目（制备精华液）偏向体验式，缺乏独立的探究深度。虽然社会议题挖掘较深，但学科本身的学术强度不足以支撑Top 30的竞争。,60,非常出色。将生物化学与美妆、国画、女性主义结合，打破了传统理工科申请者的刻板印象。“用科学视角做美妆博主”和“生物细胞水墨画”具有很强的记忆点和区分度。,90,方案设计非常契合学生的兴趣点（美妆、生物），但可能高估了学生的时间管理能力。学生目前GPA和托福（91分）压力巨大，而规划了纪录片、自媒体、社团发起等高耗时活动，可能导致标化无法达标，从而错失前30的门槛。方案强度与学生目前的硬性背景存在一定错位。,70,完美契合。女性身体自主、反消费主义、非遗保护等议题完全符合美国顶尖大学推崇的价值观，体现了极强的社会责任感和人文关怀。,100,"**Evaluation Report: Melinda's College Application Roadmap**

Alright, let's dive into this. I've got a student named Melinda, aiming for a US Top 30 college, potentially higher given her ambitions, and I'm acting as a senior college counseling expert. I need to assess her ""planning book,"" which is her roadmap for college applications, using six specific dimensions: Clearness/Consistency, Detail/Executable, Depth/Intensity, Noviceness, Fitness, and Liberal Values. The output absolutely needs to be a strict JSON format.

First, I need to get a firm grasp on the big picture. Melinda is a rising 11th grader at BASIS International School in Guangzhou, known for its academic rigor. Her sights are set on a Biology/Chemistry major, specifically Biochemistry or Cosmetic Science, with a target GPA of 3.8+ for a shot at Top 30. The application image she's cultivated is a potent blend of ""Scientific Thinking x Artistic Expression,"" combined with a ""Female Issue Advocate"" angle. That's good, a well-defined persona is half the battle.

Her academic stats paint a mixed picture. GPA needs serious work – it's the current weakest link. TOEFL is stuck at 91, and the goal is 110. AP courses are solid but no SAT prep yet, and she's aiming for a 1530 which is a very high score and needs very strong preparation.

Her extracurriculars are where things get interesting. Past activities were a bit low impact, and she's quitting the Rare Disease Assoc. Ongoing activities include Tennis and Chinese Painting, which I can see a way to integrate with her Bio/Chem focus. The planned activities are where she is going to shine, and she needs to execute these properly: a Traditional Culture Protection Club (where I suggested adding chemical analysis of dyes, fermentation, eco-friendly festivals), a Beauty Blogger (with ingredient analysis, makeup tutorials, anti-consumerism themes), LadyUp (where she will be editor/interviewer for female athletes), and a documentary on plastic surgery (This will be very difficult), and Student Researcher in Collagen peptide/Whitening essence prep & efficacy verification.

Here's the tricky part - she's specifically advised *against* competitions. That's a red flag. For a STEM major aiming at this level, I need to look into this more deeply.

Summer plans involve MMSS or Brown Pre-college.

Now, let's break this down dimension by dimension.

1.  **Clearness and Consistency (25%):** I'm seeing a strong alignment between her chosen major and the persona she's built. Biochemistry/Cosmetic Science is well defined, as is her ""Science x Art"" and ""Female Advocate"" focus. The activities, such as Beauty Blogger, Research, and Plastic Surgery Documentary, really support the persona. I'm giving this a solid 90.

2.  **Detail and Executable (25%):** Some details are strong in her plan. The chemical analysis of ancient dyes, the documentary on plastic surgery etc. However, the ""Beauty Blogger"" plan is a little generic and will need work and concrete growth strategies to succeed. The documentary's execution seems ambitious, relying heavily on just using her phone. Her detailed timeline and goals for standardized tests are good. I am giving this an 80.

3.  **Depth and Intensity (15%):** BASIS is tough; GPA is an issue and needs quick attention. ""Cosmetic Chemistry"" is interesting but at an early stage. The documentary has potential depth, but I'm concerned about the lack of any competitions. For a Top 30 STEM applicant, no competitions are a huge risk. The research project is the main concern here, especially if it's a paid program and lacks true independent depth. Cutting out competitions is a strategic risk, so a 60 here.

4.  **Noviceness (15%):** Combining Biochemistry with Chinese Painting and a feminist critique of beauty standards is very unusual. The ""Plastic Surgery Documentary"" is also a novel hook. It’s certainly not the usual pre-med shadowing or lab-rat routine. Strong differentiation earns this a 90.

5.  **Fitness (10%):** The plan is appropriate for someone interested in beauty/fashion with a STEM angle. However, she needs to address the low TOEFL and GPA. Aiming for Top 30 with these stats is a reach. It seems like the plan might be too focused on activities while her core stats are lagging. The ""no competition"" advice is fine if the GPA is a significant weakness, but the STEM profile will suffer. I’m rating this a 70.

6.  **Liberal Values (10%):** Her commitment to feminism, body autonomy, anti-consumerism, and cultural preservation aligns",

竞赛规划内容需实质性落地：目前竞赛部分（如Lumiere, Pioneer）仅写有'题目需要细分，尽可能和昆虫相关'的占位符，缺乏具体执行方案。建议结合印尼科考或中科院实验室的独家数据，现在就确定一个具体的昆虫行为学或生态学研究问题（例如特定环境下的昆虫种群密度变化），避免通用型选题。
卡牌社团（KAP）需深化教育价值与影响力：仅仅是'设计卡牌'和'开社团'在同质化竞争中略显单薄。建议引入'游戏化学习（Gamification）'的概念，设计一套评估体系来验证这套卡牌对同龄人生物分类学知识习得的有效性，将单纯的社团活动上升为具有社会科学属性的教育探究项目。
影像素材的整合与二次利用：规划中提到了'全国青少年科学影像节'和'B站频道'，这是一个很好的亮点。建议明确要求学生将印尼科考、中科院野外工作的原始素材进行专业剪辑，制作成系列科普短片或纪录片。这不仅能支撑影像节比赛，更能作为补充材料直观展示学生对野外工作的热情和吃苦耐劳的品质。

Okay, so the task at hand is to put on my admissions hat and dissect this student's planning document. Right off the bat, I need to understand what the user wants: a thorough evaluation based on specific criteria. I'm essentially acting as a senior college admissions advisor and trainer here. I need to output the analysis in JSON format, which isn't a problem. Let's dig in.

The profile screams ""Biology/Entomology/Ecology."" The student is currently in Grade 9 at the Beijing Keystone Academy. The TOEFL score of 81 is a data point, and I need to determine the student's *actual* level in the application process. I need to make a judgment here. The planning includes prestigious stuff like Cornell RABS, Pioneer, and CAS research. Given this level of activities, plus a high-resource school environment, the *realistic* target is probably Top 20-30 schools, maybe Top 10 if we get super optimistic about rapid improvement of English. I need to assess this by focusing on the *content* of the plan, while taking into account the TOEFL score. Keystone students usually aim high, let's keep that in mind. Okay, I'm going to set a target of Top 20-30 for now, but I might adjust this as I go through the plan. The high-end activities imply the student is ambitious, but I need to make sure the plan is realistic, given the TOEFL score.

The plan itself is focused. It's all about insects. The activities revolve around this central theme: CAS research, Indonesia expedition, insect card game, wetland protection, and summer schools. Clear and consistent. That's a solid start. The ""Detail and Executable"" part... well, that's where things get interesting. The timeline is detailed, with specific dates and organizations. However, some of the descriptions are generic, copied-and-pasted filler. That's a knock. It shows a lack of focused effort in some areas. But then again, the ""Card Game"" idea has a pretty concrete plan, so it's not all bad. There is a ""Topic Needs to Be Subdivided"" placeholder. The overall impression is good, but that lazy content planning will affect the score.

Now, Depth and Intensity. The CAS research is good. The Indonesia expedition is good. Cornell RABS is a *huge* reach. Pioneer/Lumiere are standard, although not top-tier unless the student gets a paper published in a top-tier journal. The card game is a bit playful, but the overall composite is a good angle. If aiming for Top 30, it's strong; for Top 20, it's decent.

Noviceness is there. Insects are a niche area of biology. The card game is a novel way to reach people and do outreach. The Indonesia trip is a cool add. I like that.

Fitness... This is where the rubber meets the road. The kid has loved insects since childhood. Great narrative. But here's the problem: The activities are ambitious, but the TOEFL score doesn't match the plan. There's a gap. The plan's got him aiming for international-level research, but the language skills aren't quite there yet. The student's plans are ambitious, which is a good thing, but it does show an opportunity for improvement.

Finally, Liberal Values are present. The student is concerned about the environment, wetlands, and biodiversity. No red flags here.

Okay, let's calculate the scores. The total is 80. A well-rounded profile.

Now, let's draft some actual feedback. We have an ""Insect Man"" with a field research background, a creative outreach plan, and a target level of 20-30, maybe more.

The major suggestion is the TOEFL gap and making sure the student is prepared for this level of academia. Next is that the competition specifics need to get filled in. The card game also needs to go deeper than just ""playing."" It needs to be a verified research output. The student's video and media projects need to get a coherent plan. And finally, if he is not serious about his golf game, he needs to get rid of it.

I'm now going to format all this information into a clear JSON output.

Okay, now let's generate the JSON string.",昆虫学本身在生物申请方向中属于相对小众且有趣的细分领域，容易做出差异化。将'昆虫科普'与'集换式卡牌游戏（TCG）'结合是一个非常有新意的点，比传统的生物社团或环保宣讲更有趣，能让人眼前一亮。

Alright, let's break this down. As a Senior International Education Planning Expert, my initial thought process is to take a deep dive. First, I have to clarify the core objective here: I'm dissecting a student's ""Planning Book"" to evaluate and pinpoint areas for improvement, using a predefined rubric. My initial assessment is the raw data presented as plain text, a somewhat cluttered snapshot of their academic and extracurricular landscape. I am using my expertise here and focusing on the underlying patterns.

My immediate focus falls on the student's profile. Grade 10 at Shanghai Pinghe is the starting point. It's a top-tier institution in Shanghai, and the dates suggest this student is heading into Grade 11. Now, looking at the quantitative markers, the TOEFL score of 84 is a significant issue. This is *low* for a Pinghe student, especially considering their presumed aspirations for top US universities. The next area is the ""Application Direction"" section, which is unfortunately empty. A glaring omission; it leaves a big question mark. However, I can infer a potential path based on their activities: Media, Communications, Film, and Marketing. The Douyin account, PTV involvement, film analysis, and the business club focusing on Kpop marketing all seem to point in this direction.

Now, let's evaluate each piece. Regarding *Clearness and Consistency*, I see a disconnect between the stated ""direction"" and the observed activities. While the activities are somewhat aligned, a strong central ""image"" is missing. Next, *Detail and Executability*, the activities and plans often lack specifics. Phrases like ""Make a series"" or ""Teach math"" need concrete plans and goals. We need quantifiable metrics and well-defined outcomes.

Moving to *Depth and Intensity*. The TOEFL score immediately raises a red flag. Compared to the caliber of a Pinghe student, the current level feels low. The Douyin presence also needs a boost. School activities are standard, but the profile has no competitions or high-impact research. The NYT Summer Academy, while good for exploration, lacks the high-level academic depth and selectivity seen in other programs.

In terms of *Noviceness*, the ""Kpop marketing"" interest and East Asian film analysis show some potential originality. Yet, these sparks aren't well-developed enough to be considered novel. These are ideas, but not yet a ""specialty."" Regarding *Fitness*, the plan, as it stands, seems a bit ""chill"" for a student with an 84 TOEFL who needs to catch up. The activities, while valid for exploration, don't scream ""prepared for college application"" at a high level. They need to address the weakness of the TOEFL. Finally, *Liberal Values* align well with the student's activities, such as ""Beyond Margins"" and ""Through Our Eyes"".

Based on these dimensions, I'm calculating a weighted score of 59, which I'll round to 60.

Now, I'm formulating concrete recommendations. Firstly, the ""Application Direction"" *must* be defined. The student needs to determine if they are on a path that is Media Studies, Marketing, or Film, among other ideas. Secondly, the TOEFL score of 84 must be the *top priority*. This needs immediate focus, even above filming vlogs.

I see a few things we can do about the activities: The Douyin account must have a theme. A more well defined path would work. For the business club, they need to leverage the ""Kpop marketing"" angle into something more concrete, like a blog series. The summer school should be enhanced to increase it's value to the application. If they can get a higher output, it will be better. The major thing here is to get them into competitions. Writing competitions are an example for them, but there are others.

In short, there's work to be done. A holistic re-evaluation and redirection are needed, with urgent action required on the standardized testing front.",

Okay, here’s how I’m approaching this evaluation. My role is that of a seasoned international education expert and counselor trainer. My goal? To dissect this “planning book” based on six key dimensions, and translate it into a structured JSON report. I need to act as though I am an expert in the field and will provide an assessment that reflects this.

First, I need to get a grip on the student's profile. Based on the activities and timeline, it's pretty clear this is a rising senior. The “Zhuhai Oriental Yinghua” connection is key context. The student’s interests? Architecture, but not just any architecture – a sociological and anthropological lens. We're talking Ethnography, Religion, Art, and Social Justice (Racism, EDI). The plan suggests a high ambition, possibly top 20-30 or better colleges. It will be helpful to refine the suggestion with the final output.

I'm now going to evaluate this student's plan.

1.  **Clearness and Consistency:** The student’s activities scream a very strong theme: ""Socially conscious architectural historian/anthropologist."" Everything aligns: the EPQ on Sacred Architecture, the research on Cemetery Architecture, the Buddhist Ethnography, and even the Racism Lectures. The problem is there is no explicitly stated ""Application Direction"" text (the section is just generic boilerplate), and that's technically a point off. But the logic is clear, and the student's intent is visible in the activities, so it gets a strong score. I'll make a note of this.

2.  **Detail and Executability:** The To-Do list is very specific (dates, names, tasks). That’s a good sign. However, some activity descriptions are a little generic. I want to see more meat. For example, ""Racism Lectures"" needs more specifics. The To-Do list will save this section.

3.  **Depth and Intensity:** The academic depth is impressive. Yuanpei Scholar, UPenn Research on Cemetery Architecture, EPQ on Sacred Architecture... it's a deep, specific niche, and a unique view. The summer programs (Carleton SLAI) and competitions (John Locke) are all selective and competitive. That is a solid profile and it earns a high score.

4.  **Noviceness:** This is where things get interesting. Most architecture portfolios focus on designs, but this student emphasizes the *social* meaning of architecture. ""Cemetery Architecture"" is a novel, slightly macabre, but intellectually fascinating angle. The combination of architecture with the exploration of death and religion is a truly unique approach.

5.  **Fitness:** Given the student’s background and the plan, it's very likely they’re targeting top US colleges. The lack of GPA or SAT score data is a downside, but the activities (Carleton, Yuanpei) suggest a high level of capability. Still, I have to be conservative in the score.

6.  **Liberal Values:** Racism Lectures, EDI committee, Therapeutic Architecture, all very much align with liberal arts values. No red flags here.

Now for the final score, it all boils down to whether the final score is an 80 or a 90. Because of the missing profile text, the score could be an 80 or 90. Even though I want to say ""the 90 is better"", the instructions tell me to take into account the instructions, and I should apply the restrictions. Because of the instructions, I am going to have to decide on an 80, but I will give the student and the counselor feedback on what they need to fix.",
90分 planbook__刘蕙瑜.md,刘蕙瑜,gemini,gemini-3-pro-preview,90,,,,,,,,,一位来自北京顶尖高中（北京一零一中）、拥有极高标化成绩（SAT 1560/TOEFL 118）的学术型申请者。申请形象鲜明地聚焦于“音乐”与“创意写作”的跨学科结合，旨在通过现代化的音乐剧创作和多媒介文学形式（有声书、诗歌平台）来探索艺术表达的新边界，同时具备通过文学关注边缘群体的社会人文情怀。,,"去‘机构化’标签：规划中提到的‘三士渡内部文学杂志’和‘三士渡内部音乐节’带有明显的机构色彩。在申请顶尖名校（藤校/前10）时，这种‘圈养式’活动可能会被招生官视为缺乏独立性。建议将这些项目重构为独立的社团或与外部非营利组织合作的项目，强调学生作为Founder的独立领导力和资源整合能力，而非依赖机构平台。
强化跨学科产出（Portfolio Synergy）：目前的规划中音乐和写作虽有交集（如音乐剧），但可以更进一步。建议在‘原创有声书’或‘Beyond Margins’项目中，明确结合两者的‘Capstone Project’，例如：为采访到的边缘诗人的作品谱曲并制作成多媒体专辑，或者创作一部基于社会调研的原创微型音乐剧剧本。这样能更直观地展示‘Music + Creative Writing’的化学反应。
科研成果的转化：CCIR/Pioneer关于‘音乐剧现代化’的科研不应止步于论文。建议将研究结论应用到实际创作中，例如在作品集中附上一篇‘基于研究理论创作的实验性乐章/剧本片段’，形成‘Theory to Practice’的闭环。
有声书项目的具体化：‘原创有声书’目前的描述略显笼统。建议细化执行方案，例如明确目标受众（如视障人士、留守儿童等），并制定具体的推广数据目标（播放量、订阅数），以增强活动的影响力（Impact）维度。",藤校、前10名,申请方向（音乐+创意写作）极度清晰，所有核心活动（Polyphony、阿卡贝拉、有声书、科研）均紧密围绕这两条主线及其交叉点展开，逻辑闭环非常严密，形象聚焦。,100,待办事项（To-Do List）部分非常出色，有精确的截止日期和量化指标（如HIR字数、提交篇数）。活动描述整体详实，但部分项目（如内部杂志、Beyond Margins）的描述略显模板化，缺乏学生本人具体操作层面的独特性细节。,80,标化成绩（1560/118）已达顶级门槛。规划中包含的BUTI（Tanglewood）是音乐类顶级夏校，Polyphony是文学类高含金量杂志，结合John Locke和高难度科研，整体学术深度和强度非常高，足以支撑藤校申请。,90,将音乐与创意写作结合本身具有一定新意，且通过‘Beyond Margins’（关注边缘群体）和‘有声书’（多媒介融合）赋予了传统艺术组合新的社会意义和表现形式，具有较好的区分度。,90,方案的高强度（顶级夏校、高难度竞赛）与学生极强的学术背景（一零一中、SAT 1560）完美匹配。申请层级定位准确，没有出现能力与规划不匹配的情况。,100,‘Beyond Margins’项目关注底层诗人和边缘群体，体现了深刻的同理心和社会正义感，极好地契合了美国顶尖大学推崇的Liberal Values。,100,"**My Assessment Process for This College Planning Document**

Okay, so here's how I'm approaching this. First, I need to understand the playing field. I see my role is a senior expert, giving advice on a student's college plan. The request is specific: analyze, score, suggest, and output a JSON report. Got it. Now, let's get into the *actual* plan.

I have to start with a deep dive into the student's profile, the timeline, and the activities. The timeline is important – especially given the mix of future dates with deadlines in 2025. It looks like the student is currently rising 11th or 12th grade. I need to make sure I've got the grade level nailed down as that heavily influences my scoring. The TOEFL 118 and SAT 1560 are both *very* impressive, which is the immediate indication that this student is targeting top tier universities. This confirms the rising 11th/12th grade theory. Beijing 101 Middle School? Excellent! The student's focus on music and creative writing is super interesting and is not a common combo.

Now, let's get to the scoring framework. I have to think about Clearness and Consistency, Detail and Executability, Depth and Intensity, Noviceness, Fitness, and Liberal Values. Each is weighted, so I must consider the importance of each. The output has to be a JSON, so I'll need to keep that in mind as I build my evaluation.

I look at the student's profile: high achieving, solid school, impressive test scores, and a focus on Music + Creative Writing. The activities are all over the place, which is good. There is Polyphony, LIT mag founder, musical theater, A Cappella, and research, but how do they all intersect? Then the competitions and summer schools... BUTI is *excellent*. Now, to judge each dimension!

Clearness and Consistency? Music + Creative Writing – that's clear. All of the student's activities support both fields, so I'm thinking a high score here. Detail and Executability. The timeline is strong with specifics, but some descriptions are vague. The descriptions for ""Beyond Margins"" (the volunteering project) and ""Audiobook"" are weak, with a clear lack of detail about implementation. So this is more of a ""good but not great"". Depth and Intensity? I'm seeing Ivy-level achievements with BUTI and Polyphony. The music intersection is smart and the volunteering adds social depth. So, a high intensity level to prepare for that level of school. Noviceness? Combining these two fields is good, but the ""Beyond Margins"" project and the ""Audiobook"" combination is where this gets unique. It's a stand out from the typical applications. Fitness: It's a top school and high stats, so it seems like the profile works for the Top 20/Ivies. Liberal Values? ""Beyond Margins"" is very socially conscious and it feels right.

Now, let's calculate the total score. C&C is 25%, D&E 25%, D&I 15%, Noviceness 15%, Fitness 10%, and Values 10%. After calculating this I get a 92, and the closest option is 90.

So, I need to offer some targeted suggestions: I think the ""internal"" projects feel a bit agency-dependent. I'll need to recommend the student show more independence. The Audiobook is a great idea, but the student needs to build out the distribution plan. With the research, the student needs to show a tangible output that's directly related to the two majors. And the Musical Theater project - leadership needs to be highlighted. Make sure there are specific ""Portfolio Polish"" periods in the timeline.

Finally, the JSON report. I need a clear profile summary, the suggested level, the suggestions, scores for each category, and a total score. I will create this JSON output, ensuring it has correct syntax.

The profile: a top student from Beijing 101, building an impressive interdisciplinary profile using music, writing, and advocacy. High level, going for those top schools.
Suggestions: De-emphasize the agency stuff, deepen the audiobook, Portfolio Synergy and a final Research Output. The output is ready, and all of the individual components align.

I'm ready to produce the report!",
90分 planbook__徐振铭.md,徐振铭,gemini,gemini-3-pro-preview,90,,,,,,,,,一位试图将中国古典哲学（易经、儒家伦理）与现代硬核科学（神经科学、天体物理）进行深度结构化整合的跨学科思考者。他不仅具备顶尖的理科解题能力，更致力于探索“世界本质与认知结构”的统一性，形象兼具东方文化底蕴与前沿科学素养。,,"关于丘成桐中学科学奖（物理）的选题：目前规划中提到的‘电学’方向相对传统且拥挤，要想在丘奖中脱颖而出，建议结合学生在天体物理或神经科学方面的跨学科优势，考虑更具新颖性的复杂系统或数据建模类课题，或者确保电学课题在实验设计上有极高的创新度。
关于申请形象的风险控制：将《易经》与现代天体物理结合是一个极具新颖性但也伴随高风险的尝试。在文书和面试中，必须严格界定在‘认识论’和‘哲学模型’的层面进行比较，避免给招生官留下‘用玄学解释科学’的伪科学印象，需强调这是一种跨文化的思维结构探索。
关于IB选课调整：建议将英语B调整为英语A是一个展示语言能力的妙招，但需谨慎评估学生对文学批评和文本分析的实际掌控力。IB英语A的难度远高于托福，若因此导致GPA受损得不偿失，建议在暑期先进行试读或评估后再做最终决定。
关于时间管理与活动优先级：11年级面临IB课业、标化考试（SAT/托福刷分）、高强度竞赛（丘奖、John Locke）和科研（北邮项目）的多重压力。建议制定明确的优先级，若时间冲突，应优先保证丘奖和科研产出，因为这对Top 10申请的学术支撑作用最大，社团类活动可适当放权给他人。",前10名,申请方向（哲学、神经科学、天体物理）虽然跨度极大，但通过‘探索世界本质与认知结构’这一核心逻辑链条完美串联。从活动（易经讲座、脑科学社）到竞赛（John Locke、丘奖）再到文书意向（EE论文），所有安排都紧密围绕这一独特形象展开，逻辑自洽且高度聚焦，满分。,100,规划书极其详尽，不仅有宏观策略，还有具体的执行动作（如‘7.17去曲阜’、‘跟周老师约聊’）。活动描述具体到了产出形式（PPT、论文、公众号文章）。标化考试规划精确到了具体的分数目标和月份。极具可执行性。,100,学术强度极高，目标直指Top 10。IB HL课程组合硬核，竞赛选择了丘成桐和USABO/BPhO等高含金量赛事，夏校瞄准了SSP/YSPA等顶尖项目。科研项目有大学教授指导。整体深度完全匹配申请层级要求。,90,新颖度极高。将‘易经/儒家伦理’与‘神经科学/天体物理’结合的申请形象在高中生中极为罕见，极具区分度。‘疯人映世’公众号的内容策划和EE选题都让人眼前一亮，打破了传统理工男或传统文史哲学生的刻板印象。,100,方案高度适配学生背景。学生来自顶尖高中（十一学校），托福112分，理科基础扎实，有能力消化高强度的规划。曲阜孔子学院的活动安排巧妙利用了地缘文化背景，增强了人设的真实性。,90,规划中体现了对人类认知、伦理道德、跨文化理解的深刻关怀，特别是通过教学反哺社区（蒲公英中学）的安排，很好地体现了社会责任感和人文情怀，符合博雅教育价值观。,90,"**Analyzing Xu Zhenming's College Counseling Plan**

Alright, let's dive into this evaluation. First, I need to thoroughly understand the goal: I'm dissecting this plan for Xu Zhenming (小徐), looking at its effectiveness across six key dimensions. It's about delivering a structured, JSON-formatted assessment with concrete scores and insightful suggestions.

I start by building a comprehensive profile of Xu. This student's a rising 11th grader at BNDS. His academics are stellar, with high GPAs and strong standardized test scores. What's truly intriguing is his interest profile: a blend of Philosophy, Neuroscience, and Astrophysics. I'm taking note of the unique narrative: a thinker bridging Eastern thought and modern science. His target is ambitious: Top 10-20 US universities.

Next, the meat of the matter: the plan itself. The activities are solid, a mix of established commitments and future plans. I like the planned integration of ""I Ching"" with neuroscience and astrophysics; that's something special. The competitions are impressive, including things like USABO and Yau Science. Summer school choices are top-tier, like SSP and YSPA.

Now, let's break it down dimension by dimension. First, **Clearness and Consistency**. This plan is like a perfectly woven tapestry, integrating everything around the central themes. It's a clear, cohesive narrative, so I'm giving it a perfect 100.

Second, **Detail and Executability**. The plan is rich with specifics, including very detailed timelines, test targets, and clear descriptions of activities. The specificity warrants a 90.

Third, **Depth and Intensity**. IB HL Physics/Math/Bio is tough and the summer programs are top-tier. Yau is tough, but the planned combination of ""I Ching"" and Astrophysics creates some exciting possibilities and, therefore, a score of 90.

Fourth, **Noviceness**. Here's where the plan truly shines. The unique combination of Chinese classics and hard science makes it stand out – a textbook example. This earns a solid 100.

Fifth, **Fitness**. Given Xu's strong background and ambition, the plan seems well-suited to his capabilities. It’s ambitious, but believable, so I'm giving it a 90.

Sixth, **Liberal Values**. The focus on universal truth, ethics, and cross-cultural understanding is right in line with liberal values. No red flags here; a 90 is appropriate.

Now, for the numbers. I've crunched them, giving Clearness and Noviceness 100 and a score of 90 for the rest. This gives a weighted total of 94. My initial inclination was to stay conservative and give an even 90. However, the plan included a specific ""To-Do"" list with dates and concrete descriptions of research projects, pushing this to the 100 range. After being very critical, I've decided to hold back on the 100, and keep the final score at 90. It's a *very* strong plan.

I need to provide actionable suggestions, so I need to assess any potential drawbacks. The plan relies heavily on intellectual output, and I need to address the risk of burnout. Regarding the Yau Award topic, it needs to be specific. The ""Electricity"" topic, on its own, seems a bit broad. It needs a novel angle to stand out. And finally, I need to address the switch to English A; I need to ensure it won’t negatively affect the GPA. The student needs to be very strong to make this a good move. Furthermore, I must note that the ""I Ching"" angle is brilliant but also risky. In the essay, it needs to be framed in terms of ""Epistemology"" or ""Structural Philosophy"" to avoid the appearance of pseudoscience.

Finally, I'll craft the final report: a concise, informative profile and a set of targeted recommendations. It's time to generate that JSON output and finish this evaluation.",
