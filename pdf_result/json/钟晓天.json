Academic Decathlon，中国学生除了可以通过SKT报名参加中国赛区的赛事，非体制内的国际学校学员有机会通过学校向美国官方申请参加美国本土举行的比赛。中国区活动接受3到6人的跨校队伍报名。比赛设置7大主题分别是Art,Economics，Literature, Math, Music, Science, and Social Science，另考察的3项学术能力分别是Essay,Speech,Interview，所以一共是10项科目的考试，这才被命名为十项全能。每年比赛设置一个主题，比如2022-2023赛季的是The American Revolution and the New Nation，2024~2025主题是Technology and Humanity，每门客观考试科目的内容都会与当年的主题相关。竞赛环节主要有三项，分别是：个人以演讲／面试形式展开的开放性学科竞赛，个人以答题形式展开的数学、音乐和经济学的客观学科比赛，团体展开的限时客观知识超级问答赛。美国区比赛以学校为单位报名，每一个参赛团队的成员会按照学术水平由高到低被分为三个组别：Honor Students／荣誉组（GPA3.8~4.0),Scholastic Students／学者组（GPA3.2~3.799),Varsity students／队打组（GPA<3.799）。以下是从各种Brochure和推文中查到的具体赛制和内容介绍：1）开放性学科竞赛Speech & Interview即个人赛形式中的演讲、面试与写作，这3个科目将采取主观表达竞赛的方式进行。除了没有Hackthon，其他大体上与中国赛的开放性学科竞赛无太大差别。A．备稿演讲（Prepared Speech)：时长3.5-4分钟，你将在评委面前做一个事先准备好的演讲，评委将对你的演讲内容，语言表达和演讲礼仪等进行专业的评估，同时会让你就某个话题进行即兴演讲。B．即兴演讲（Impromptu Speech)：时长1.5-2分钟，你将从三个topic中抽取一个进行演讲，有一分钟准备时间。C．面试时长4-7分钟，话题涉及你学习生活的方方面面。面试没有标准答案，考察的是你的应变和沟通能力。2）客观学科比赛Objective Tests即个人赛形式中的限时客观知识答题：数学：共有35道单选题，比赛时间为30分钟；音乐：共有50道单选题，其中12道题目需要音频分析，比赛时间为30分钟；经济、语言和文学、科学、社会科学：每个学科均有50道单选题，比赛时间均为30分钟。3）超级问答Super

Education每年提供多学术方向，每个方向各自设立问题供投稿人选择，但每篇文章字数要求不超过500字（最多允许10％增减），和JL的字数要求就显得大相径庭。所有学术分享基于投稿人年龄分成13~15 Years Old和16~18岁两个组别各自评奖，从获奖结果来看这项写作比赛的竞争会比JL写作比赛激烈，但是目前知道这项赛事的中国本土学生并不多，获奖后在大学申请中申报这一信息时就会给一些看腻了JL

Organization联合承办，目前在全球50多个国家和地区拥有200多个分会，2013年入驻中国，2015年开始在国内逐渐积攒热度，是集合了生物、化学和神经科学类专业知识的答题竞赛，尤其在神经科学领域的赛事中有很好的认可度。以中国区的赛事为例，目前BrainBee基于参赛者年级分为5到8年级的初级组／Brain Bee Junior，和常规的9到12年级Brain Bee两个组别各自进行比赛。Brain Bee从比赛量级上分为地区级和全国级的赛事，受到疫情关系直到2023年各活动地区（省、直辖市、自治区）都未曾设集中统一活动点，各学校可在官网自行申请成为地区活动的基地学校，以学校为单位统一报名参加地区赛。以下是两个级别赛事的具体情况：-地区赛，比赛采取全国统一命题、统一阅卷，各赛区设考点统一时间比赛的模式。原则上以学校为单位报名，如果参赛者所在学校不准备集体报名，个人学员需要等到集体报名时段结束后再报名参赛。比赛时间为90分钟，共80道题（原先是100题题目数量下降），分为填空和选择两种题型（原本的比赛还有判断题，考试难度也有下降的趋势），每题1分，满分80。试题为中文，专业术语在试题中均用中英文标出；答题中如需填写专业术语，用中文或者英文（包括英文缩写）填写均可，答对即得分。地区赛到全国赛的总晋级概率在20％到25％左右；-全国赛，Brain Bee也是个人赛，9-12年级组别的笔试分为60道选择题和填空题，15道图片标本识别题，10道病例诊断题三个部分，均可中英文答题。全国赛主要考察的学科知识点有Anatomy，Diagnosis, Live Q&A, Written Histology, Magnetic Resonance Imaging 中国区总成绩排名第一的选手将作为中国代表参加BrainBee的全球活动。全球赛形式和全国赛基本一致。"},{"id":105,"outline_level":-1,"pos":[597,37825,5091,37824,5089,38937,593,38938],"rows":4,"rows_height":[314,262,230,188],"sub_type":"bordered","text":"<table

for Excellence in Education发起，是美国的生物奥赛国家队选拔赛，缩写为USABO，由ASDAN在大约2018年引进国内，中国版的USABO比赛从2022年起正式更名为BioOlympiad Initiative USA-China，有时缩写又会叫BIO USACN。顾名思义美国以外国家的非美国籍学生可以参加这个版本的竞赛，比赛赛程仅一轮；美国版的比赛分为Open Exam,Semifinals,Final三个阶段，有一种说法是从初赛阶段开始就不允许非美国籍或者永居的学生报名，但是从美国比赛官网的Eligibility来看官方的说辞比较暖昧，只确定了非美国籍参赛者不能参加Semifinals和Finals的竞赛，对Open Exam的国籍要求没有给出明确咨询，所以建议在美高念书的中国籍学生提前和学校老师确认Open Exam的报名资格，或者咨询ASDAN人工看是否有机会以个人身份报名然后在中国考试的时间进行网上测试。赛事总体来说是知名度和含金量都还算不错的生物比赛，考点基本覆盖美国高中的生物课程和AP 生物的内容。比赛初赛名为Open Exam，形式为笔试，考试形式为50道选择题，时长50分钟，考点涵盖的内容分别是：细胞生物学，植物解剖学及生理学，动物解剖学及生理学，动物行为学，遗传与进化，生态学，生物分类学。和英国版的生物奥赛一致，非美国籍参赛者不参与排名，但基于美国参赛者的成绩分数线划奖。","type":"textblock","content":[298,299,300,301,302,303,304,305,306,307]},{"sub_type":"bordered","type":"table","columns_width":[976,1522,1007,619],"id":113,"text":"<table

Academic Decathlon，中国学生除了可以通过SKT报名参加中国赛区的赛事，非体制内的国际学校学员有机会通过学校向美国官方申请参加美国本土举行的比赛。中国区活动接受3到6人的跨校队伍报名。比赛设置7大主题分别是Art,Economics，Literature, Math, Music, Science, and Social Science，另考察的3项学术能力分别是Essay,Speech,Interview，所以一共是10项科目的考试，这才被命名为十项全能。每年比赛设置一个主题，比如2022-2023赛季的是The American Revolution and the New Nation，2024~2025主题是Technology and Humanity，每门客观考试科目的内容都会与当年的主题相关。竞赛环节主要有三项，分别是：个人以演讲／面试形式展开的开放性学科竞赛，个人以答题形式展开的数学、音乐和经济学的客观学科比赛，团体展开的限时客观知识超级问答赛。美国区比赛以学校为单位报名，每一个参赛团队的成员会按照学术水平由高到低被分为三个组别：Honor Students／荣誉组（GPA3.8~4.0),Scholastic Students／学者组（GPA3.2~3.799),Varsity students／队打组（GPA&lt;3.799）。以下是从各种Brochure和推文中查到的具体赛制和内容介绍：1）开放性学科竞赛Speech & Interview即个人赛形式中的演讲、面试与写作，这3个科目将采取主观表达竞赛的方式进行。除了没有Hackthon，其他大体上与中国赛的开放性学科竞赛无太大差别。A．备稿演讲（Prepared Speech)：时长3.5-4分钟，你将在评委面前做一个事先准备好的演讲，评委将对你的演讲内容，语言表达和演讲礼仪等进行专业的评估，同时会让你就某个话题进行即兴演讲。B．即兴演讲（Impromptu Speech)：时长1.5-2分钟，你将从三个topic中抽取一个进行演讲，有一分钟准备时间。C．面试时长4-7分钟，话题涉及你学习生活的方方面面。面试没有标准答案，考察的是你的应变和沟通能力。2）客观学科比赛Objective Tests即个人赛形式中的限时客观知识答题：数学：共有35道单选题，比赛时间为30分钟；音乐：共有50道单选题，其中12道题目需要音频分析，比赛时间为30分钟；经济、语言和文学、科学、社会科学：每个学科均有50道单选题，比赛时间均为30分钟。3）超级问答Super Quiz即限时团队客观知识答题项目，每支参赛队伍共分三轮比赛，将分别由队打组、学者组、荣誉组依次上场作答。超级问答是USAD中唯一公开的可观摩环节，采用大屏幕显示题目，主持人进行同步读题的形式，主持人念完题目之后，同一组别的选手将有10秒时间共同商量作答。每轮约有10道单选题，每支队伍共回答约30道单选题，题目内容来自于7个客观学科的官方备赛指南。","type":"paragraph"},{"cells":[{"page_id":7,"position":[590,5124,1769,5124,1769,5429,590,5429],"row":0,"row_span":1,"text":"参加年级<br>10

Education每年提供多学术方向，每个方向各自设立问题供投稿人选择，但每篇文章字数要求不超过500字（最多允许10％增减），和JL的字数要求就显得大相径庭。所有学术分享基于投稿人年龄分成13~15 Years Old和16~18岁两个组别各自评奖，从获奖结果来看这项写作比赛的竞争会比JL写作比赛激烈，但是目前知道这项赛事的中国本土学生并不多，获奖后在大学申请中申报这一信息时就会给一些看腻了JL Finalists/Shortlist奖项的大学AO耳目一新的感受；比赛学术性不错还有名校夏校的加持，只是目前在中美的关注度还没有变得十分热烈，再经过一段时间的成长相信会有更多热度。此条目收集的是高年级组别的学术分支和问题，每个学年的写作问题各有不同，历年的获奖文章可参考此链接https://www.immerse.education/essay-competition/winners/","type":"paragraph","paragraph_id":24,"position":[608,8420,5730,8420,5730,9530,608,9530],"tags":[]},{"page_id":7,"paragraph_id":25,"text":"<table

Organization联合承办，目前在全球50多个国家和地区拥有200多个分会，2013年入驻中国，2015年开始在国内逐渐积攒热度，是集合了生物、化学和神经科学类专业知识的答题竞赛，尤其在神经科学领域的赛事中有很好的认可度。以中国区的赛事为例，目前BrainBee基于参赛者年级分为5到8年级的初级组／Brain Bee Junior，和常规的9到12年级Brain Bee两个组别各自进行比赛。Brain Bee从比赛量级上分为地区级和全国级的赛事，受到疫情关系直到2023年各活动地区（省、直辖市、自治区）都未曾设集中统一活动点，各学校可在官网自行申请成为地区活动的基地学校，以学校为单位统一报名参加地区赛。以下是两个级别赛事的具体情况：-地区赛，比赛采取全国统一命题、统一阅卷，各赛区设考点统一时间比赛的模式。原则上以学校为单位报名，如果参赛者所在学校不准备集体报名，个人学员需要等到集体报名时段结束后再报名参赛。比赛时间为90分钟，共80道题（原先是100题题目数量下降），分为填空和选择两种题型（原本的比赛还有判断题，考试难度也有下降的趋势），每题1分，满分80。试题为中文，专业术语在试题中均用中英文标出；答题中如需填写专业术语，用中文或者英文（包括英文缩写）填写均可，答对即得分。地区赛到全国赛的总晋级概率在20％到25％左右；-全国赛，Brain Bee也是个人赛，9-12年级组别的笔试分为60道选择题和填空题，15道图片标本识别题，10道病例诊断题三个部分，均可中英文答题。全国赛主要考察的学科知识点有Anatomy，Diagnosis, Live Q&A, Written Histology, Magnetic Resonance Imaging 中国区总成绩排名第一的选手将作为中国代表参加BrainBee的全球活动。全球赛形式和全国赛基本一致。","type":"paragraph","content":0,"outline_level":-1,"page_id":7,"paragraph_id":104,"position":[602,35961,5784,35961,5784,37706,602,37706],"sub_type":"text","tags":[]},{"cells":[{"row":0,"row_span":1,"text":"参加年级<br>11/12年级；","type":"cell","col":0,"col_span":1,"page_id":7,"position":[604,37836,1565,37836,1565,38153,604,38153]},{"position":[1555,37836,3095,37836,3095,38153,1555,38153],"row":0,"row_span":1,"text":"奖项Title","type":"cell","col":1,"col_span":1,"page_id":7},{"row":0,"row_span":1,"text":"获奖等级","type":"cell","col":2,"col_span":1,"page_id":7,"position":[3095,37836,4107,37836,4107,38153,3095,38153]},{"page_id":7,"position":[4107,37836,4942,37836,4942,38153,4107,38153],"row":0,"row_span":1,"text":"","type":"cell","col":3,"col_span":1},{"row_span":1,"text":"筹备时间","type":"cell","col":0,"col_span":1,"page_id":7,"position":[604,38153,1555,38153,1555,38415,604,38415],"row":1},{"row_span":1,"text":"报名截止时间","type":"cell","col":1,"col_span":1,"page_id":7,"position":[1555,38153,3095,38153,3095,38415,1555,38415],"row":1},{"col_span":1,"page_id":7,"position":[3095,38153,4107,38153,4107,38415,3095,38415],"row":1,"row_span":1,"text":"难度","type":"cell","col":2},{"col_span":1,"page_id":7,"position":[4107,38153,4942,38153,4942,38415,4107,38415],"row":1,"row_span":1,"text":"重要性","type":"cell","col":3},{"col":0,"col_span":1,"page_id":7,"position":[604,38415,1565,38415,1565,38646,604,38646],"row":2,"row_span":1,"text":"竞赛描述","type":"cell"},{"row_span":1,"text":"","type":"cell","col":1,"col_span":1,"page_id":7,"position":[1555,38415,3095,38415,3095,38646,1555,38646],"row":2},{"position":[3095,38415,4107,38415,4107,38646,3095,38646],"row":2,"row_span":1,"text":"","type":"cell","col":2,"col_span":1,"page_id":7},{"row":2,"row_span":1,"text":"","type":"cell","col":3,"col_span":1,"page_id":7,"position":[4107,38415,4942,38415,4942,38646,4107,38646]},{"text":"规划理由","type":"cell","col":0,"col_span":1,"page_id":7,"position":[604,38646,1565,38646,1565,38837,604,38837],"row":3,"row_span":1},{"position":[1565,38646,3095,38646,3095,38837,1565,38837],"row":3,"row_span":1,"text":"","type":"cell","col":1,"col_span":1,"page_id":7},{"row":3,"row_span":1,"text":"","type":"cell","col":2,"col_span":1,"page_id":7,"position":[3095,38646,4107,38646,4107,38837,3095,38837]},{"row_span":1,"text":"","type":"cell","col":3,"col_span":1,"page_id":7,"position":[4107,38646,4942,38646,4942,38837,4107,38837],"row":3}],"content":0,"outline_level":-1,"text":"<table

奖项介绍\n\nUSAD设有中美两大赛，两个赛区各自安排赛程和评奖，2022年时中国区被取消了办理比赛资格，之后由SKT申请到了举办资质，中国区赛事改名为SKT-China Academic Decathlon，中国学生除了可以通过SKT报名参加中国赛区的赛事，非体制内的国际学校学员有机会通过学校向美国官方申请参加美国本土举行的比赛。中国区活动接受3到6人的跨校队伍报名。比赛设置7大主题分别是Art,Economics，Literature, Math, Music, Science, and Social Science，另考察的3项学术能力分别是Essay,Speech,Interview，所以一共是10项科目的考试，这才被命名为十项全能。每年比赛设置一个主题，比如2022-2023赛季的是The American Revolution and the New Nation，2024~2025主题是Technology and Humanity，每门客观考试科目的内容都会与当年的主题相关。竞赛环节主要有三项，分别是：个人以演讲／面试形式展开的开放性学科竞赛，个人以答题形式展开的数学、音乐和经济学的客观学科比赛，团体展开的限时客观知识超级问答赛。美国区比赛以学校为单位报名，每一个参赛团队的成员会按照学术水平由高到低被分为三个组别：Honor Students／荣誉组（GPA3.8~4.0),Scholastic Students／学者组（GPA3.2~3.799),Varsity students／队打组（GPA&lt;3.799）。以下是从各种Brochure和推文中查到的具体赛制和内容介绍：1）开放性学科竞赛Speech & Interview即个人赛形式中的演讲、面试与写作，这3个科目将采取主观表达竞赛的方式进行。除了没有Hackthon，其他大体上与中国赛的开放性学科竞赛无太大差别。A．备稿演讲（Prepared Speech)：时长3.5-4分钟，你将在评委面前做一个事先准备好的演讲，评委将对你的演讲内容，语言表达和演讲礼仪等进行专业的评估，同时会让你就某个话题进行即兴演讲。B．即兴演讲（Impromptu Speech)：时长1.5-2分钟，你将从三个topic中抽取一个进行演讲，有一分钟准备时间。C．面试时长4-7分钟，话题涉及你学习生活的方方面面。面试没有标准答案，考察的是你的应变和沟通能力。2）客观学科比赛Objective Tests即个人赛形式中的限时客观知识答题：数学：共有35道单选题，比赛时间为30分钟；音乐：共有50道单选题，其中12道题目需要音频分析，比赛时间为30分钟；经济、语言和文学、科学、社会科学：每个学科均有50道单选题，比赛时间均为30分钟。3）超级问答Super Quiz即限时团队客观知识答题项目，每支参赛队伍共分三轮比赛，将分别由队打组、学者组、荣誉组依次上场作答。超级问答是USAD中唯一公开的可观摩环节，采用大屏幕显示题目，主持人进行同步读题的形式，主持人念完题目之后，同一组别的选手将有10秒时间共同商量作答。每轮约有10道单选题，每支队伍共回答约30道单选题，题目内容来自于7个客观学科的官方备赛指南。\n\n<table border=\"1\"

Education是一家始创于英国的教育机构，主要为全球高中生提供英国和澳洲名校的的线上或线下暑期课程，在英联邦国家的各个高中受到很多关注。机构创办的写作比赛也经常被英制高中的老师推荐，一年举办一或两次，每年春季和秋季学期的开学前后经常是比赛截稿的时间。和约翰洛克写作比赛相似，Immerse Education每年提供多学术方向，每个方向各自设立问题供投稿人选择，但每篇文章字数要求不超过500字（最多允许10％增减），和JL的字数要求就显得大相径庭。所有学术分享基于投稿人年龄分成13~15 Years Old和16~18岁两个组别各自评奖，从获奖结果来看这项写作比赛的竞争会比JL写作比赛激烈，但是目前知道这项赛事的中国本土学生并不多，获奖后在大学申请中申报这一信息时就会给一些看腻了JL Finalists/Shortlist奖项的大学AO耳目一新的感受；比赛学术性不错还有名校夏校的加持，只是目前在中美的关注度还没有变得十分热烈，再经过一段时间的成长相信会有更多热度。此条目收集的是高年级组别的学术分支和问题，每个学年的写作问题各有不同，历年的获奖文章可参考此链接https://www.immerse.education/essay-competition/winners/\n\n<table

Bee两个组别各自进行比赛。Brain Bee从比赛量级上分为地区级和全国级的赛事，受到疫情关系直到2023年各活动地区（省、直辖市、自治区）都未曾设集中统一活动点，各学校可在官网自行申请成为地区活动的基地学校，以学校为单位统一报名参加地区赛。以下是两个级别赛事的具体情况：-地区赛，比赛采取全国统一命题、统一阅卷，各赛区设考点统一时间比赛的模式。原则上以学校为单位报名，如果参赛者所在学校不准备集体报名，个人学员需要等到集体报名时段结束后再报名参赛。比赛时间为90分钟，共80道题（原先是100题题目数量下降），分为填空和选择两种题型（原本的比赛还有判断题，考试难度也有下降的趋势），每题1分，满分80。试题为中文，专业术语在试题中均用中英文标出；答题中如需填写专业术语，用中文或者英文（包括英文缩写）填写均可，答对即得分。地区赛到全国赛的总晋级概率在20％到25％左右；-全国赛，Brain Bee也是个人赛，9-12年级组别的笔试分为60道选择题和填空题，15道图片标本识别题，10道病例诊断题三个部分，均可中英文答题。全国赛主要考察的学科知识点有Anatomy，Diagnosis, Live Q&A, Written Histology, Magnetic Resonance Imaging 中国区总成绩排名第一的选手将作为中国代表参加BrainBee的全球活动。全球赛形式和全国赛基本一致。\n\n<table border=\"1\"

Exam的国籍要求没有给出明确咨询，所以建议在美高念书的中国籍学生提前和学校老师确认Open Exam的报名资格，或者咨询ASDAN人工看是否有机会以个人身份报名然后在中国考试的时间进行网上测试。赛事总体来说是知名度和含金量都还算不错的生物比赛，考点基本覆盖美国高中的生物课程和AP 生物的内容。比赛初赛名为Open Exam，形式为笔试，考试形式为50道选择题，时长50分钟，考点涵盖的内容分别是：细胞生物学，植物解剖学及生理学，动物解剖学及生理学，动物行为学，遗传与进化，生态学，生物分类学。和英国版的生物奥赛一致，非美国籍参赛者不参与排名，但基于美国参赛者的成绩分数线划奖。\n\n<table border=\"1\"
