Leadership Conference。整套HOSA赛事大致分为地区站和全球站这两个级别的赛程，美国本土参赛者从各州晋级到决赛，美国以外的参赛学生从本国晋级到决赛，但中国区的地区站经常还会多一项名为初选站的前序赛事。中国区所有参赛者将基于高中年级被分为9到10年级的Division I和11到12年级的Division II两个组别，所有组别都要求参赛者以学校社团的形式备赛然后参与地区站的活动，每个社团成员至少5人；美国区则分成初中组和高中组两个组别。美国本土版的HOSA赛事基本采取同校报名的原则，中国区的HOSA因为有SKT的代理，学生如果不想和同学组队也可以联系SKT分配队友。美国本土的HOSA赛制不变，但中国区的HOSA比赛从2021年后进行了调整和改革，以2022~2023学年为例，地区站和全球站的赛事将设为三个板块的挑战项目，分别是名为Academic Testing Center以下简称ATC的基础学科挑战，Benneficial Competitive Event Event以下简称BCE的原创公益实践挑战，Career-Oriented Competitive Event以下简称CCE的专业学术挑战。美国区HOSA的不一定每年有BCE项目，但是ATC开放的学科非常多，且美国HOSA的CCE可选择的学科总数达到64门，具体可见https://hosa.org/guidelines／。HOSA所有的挑战项目所涉及的学术方向包括但不限于生物，化学，心理学／行为学，营养学，广告，传媒等。以下还会介绍中国区的三大挑战初选阶段的比赛详情：Academic Testing Center-挑战形式是个人学科考试，中国区的比赛只主考生物与化学两门学科，考试形式全部为单选题，每门课考试时长45分钟。生物学的主要考点分别是Principles of Cellular Life细胞生物原理，Genetics遗传学，Principles of Evolution进化原理，How Animals Work动物技能，Principles of Ecology生态学原理；化学的主要考点分别是Chemical Foundations化学基础，Atoms Molecules Lons原子分子离子，Stoichiometry化学计量学，Thermochemistry热力学，Chemical Kinetics化学动力学，Bonding and Covalent Bonding 化学键和共价键，Liquids and Solids液体和固体，Acids and Bases酸和碱。中国区目前仅开放两门学科，美国区的ATC挑战还得到美国国家地理学术中心National Geographic Learning和美国圣智集团Cengage Learning的支持，提供了更多学科选项共有14项学科测试可选，详情可见美国官网https://hosa.org/guidelines／进入连接后下拉进度条至National Geographic Learning Academic Testing Center。 -Beneficial Competitive Event-挑战形式为团队项目提交，主要做的是请各参赛社团组成一个或若干个团队，每个团队策划并实现一项可落地操作的原创公益项目，线上提交给组委会进行作品评选。HOSA给的公益项目分以下几个选项：1.30秒公益广告／Public Service Announcement,3-6人的团队项目，要求基于年度主题拍摄和制作一条不超过30秒的广告，比如2022~2023学年比赛的主题是How to Talk to Friends and Family about Mental Health; 2．公益健康课堂／Health Education,2-4人的团队项目，要求团队自选一个公共健康相关的议题，定好受众群，策划并成功举办一场非盈利性的公益课程。历年的优秀案例有在养老社区进行阿兹海默症科普，去学校授课呼吁关注青少年牙齿健康问题等。3．心理健康青年行动／Mental Health Promotion,2-6人的团队项目，需要团队以青少年的心理健康情况为议题，以社交媒体为平台，策划并实现一场科普宣传活动。最后要注意该项目是中国特供，美国本土HOSA不设同款。Career Oriented Competitive Event-挑战形式为大学预选课难度的个人学科测试，考试形式为单选题，时长45分钟，中国区可选择的考试科目有行为健康学／Behavioral Health，营养学／Nutrition，病理生理学Pathophysiology，生物实验室／Biomedical Lab Science，心肺复苏／CPR First Aid。美国本土HOSA可由高中生选择的CE科目则非常多，所有科目会按照类别分成Health Science Events,Health Professional Events,Emergency Preparedness Events, Leadership Events, Teamwork Events, Recognition Events。每个学校社团的参赛学生可以在HOSA中自由选择1到3个学科测试或挑战项目，每个类别仅可参与一个项目。中国区中一般每个挑战项目评分或者每门学科总成绩排名大约前45％的团队能从全国初选晋级到中国站峰会，在中国站峰会各项目排名前3的团队（据说晋级率约5%）将会和美国各州排名前3的团队共同晋级全球站峰会。","content":0,"page_id":7,"type":"paragraph","outline_level":-1},{"sub_type":"text","tags":[],"content":0,"outline_level":-1,"paragraph_id":32,"position":[613,10699,974,10699,974,10782,613,10782],"text":"参加年级","type":"paragraph","page_id":7},{"position":[2091,10699,2476,10699,2476,10779,2091,10779],"sub_type":"text","tags":[],"text":"奖项Title","content":0,"outline_level":-1,"page_id":7,"type":"paragraph","paragraph_id":31},{"content":0,"page_id":7,"paragraph_id":30,"tags":[],"text":"获奖等级","outline_level":-1,"position":[3570,10698,3954,10698,3954,10780,3570,10780],"sub_type":"text","type":"paragraph"},{"sub_type":"text","tags":[],"text":"**筹备时间**","type":"paragraph","outline_level":-1,"content":0,"page_id":7,"paragraph_id":34,"position":[601,10926,974,10926,974,11006,601,11006]},{"paragraph_id":33,"sub_type":"text","tags":[],"text":"报名截止时间","content":0,"position":[2091,10927,2632,10927,2632,11008,2091,11008],"type":"paragraph","outline_level":-1,"page_id":7},{"type":"paragraph","content":0,"outline_level":-1,"page_id":7,"paragraph_id":36,"position":[3582,10927,3774,10927,3774,11011,3582,11011],"sub_type":"text","tags":[],"text":"难度"},{"content":0,"outline_level":-1,"page_id":7,"position":[4435,10929,4724,10929,4724,11010,4435,11010],"tags":[],"paragraph_id":35,"sub_type":"text","text":"重要性","type":"paragraph"},{"paragraph_id":37,"position":[613,11153,974,11153,974,11237,613,11237],"type":"paragraph","outline_level":-1,"page_id":7,"sub_type":"text","tags":[],"text":"竞赛描述","content":0},{"outline_level":-1,"page_id":7,"position":[601,11383,974,11383,974,11465,601,11465],"sub_type":"text","type":"paragraph","content":0,"paragraph_id":38,"tags":[],"text":"规划理由"},{"image_url":"https://web-api.textin.com/ocr_image/external/666219bd814fd4c9.jpg","paragraph_id":0,"position":[442,351,2621,351,2620,1001,440,1001],"sub_type":"header","type":"image","content":1,"outline_level":-1,"page_id":8,"text":"000"},{"image_url":"https://web-api.textin.com/ocr_image/external/cd053920a69d10b9.jpg","paragraph_id":3,"position":[4496,704,4737,705,4738,945,4497,945],"sub_type":"header","text":"","type":"image","outline_level":-1,"page_id":8,"content":1},{"content":1,"outline_level":-1,"page_id":8,"sub_type":"header","text":"夏校","paragraph_id":2,"position":[5229,721,5461,721,5461,851,5229,851],"tags":[],"type":"paragraph"},{"outline_level":-1,"page_id":8,"sub_type":"header","tags":[],"content":1,"paragraph_id":5,"position":[4765,835,5477,835,5477,959,4765,959],"text":"**Summer

2．公益健康课堂／Health Education,2-4人的团队项目，要求团队自选一个公共健康相关的议题，定好受众群，策划并成功举办一场非盈利性的公益课程。历年的优秀案例有在养老社区进行阿兹海默症科普，去学校授课呼吁关注青少年牙齿健康问题等。3．心理健康青年行动／Mental Health Promotion,2-6人的团队项目，需要团队以青少年的心理健康情况为议题，以社交媒体为平台，策划并实现一场科普宣传活动。最后要注意该项目是中国特供，美国本土HOSA不设同款。Career Oriented Competitive Event-挑战形式为大学预选课难度的个人学科测试，考试形式为单选题，时长45分钟，中国区可选择的考试科目有行为健康学／Behavioral Health，营养学／Nutrition，病理生理学Pathophysiology，生物实验室／Biomedical Lab Science，心肺复苏／CPR First Aid。美国本土HOSA可由高中生选择的CE科目则非常多，所有科目会按照类别分成Health Science Events,Health Professional Events,Emergency Preparedness Events, Leadership Events, Teamwork Events, Recognition Events。每个学校社团的参赛学生可以在HOSA中自由选择1到3个学科测试或挑战项目，每个类别仅可参与一个项目。中国区中一般每个挑战项目评分或者每门学科总成绩排名大约前45％的团队能从全国初选晋级到中国站峰会，在中国站峰会各项目排名前3的团队（据说晋级率约5%）将会和美国各州排名前3的团队共同晋级全球站峰会。","type":"textblock"},{"text":"参加年级","type":"textblock","content":[76],"id":32,"outline_level":-1,"pos":[613,10699,974,10699,974,10782,613,10782],"sub_type":"text"},{"text":"奖项Title","type":"textblock","content":[77],"id":31,"outline_level":-1,"pos":[2091,10699,2476,10699,2476,10779,2091,10779],"sub_type":"text"},{"sub_type":"text","text":"获奖等级","type":"textblock","content":[78],"id":30,"outline_level":-1,"pos":[3570,10698,3954,10698,3954,10780,3570,10780]},{"type":"textblock","content":[79],"id":34,"outline_level":-1,"pos":[601,10926,974,10926,974,11006,601,11006],"sub_type":"text","text":"筹备时间"},{"pos":[2091,10927,2632,10927,2632,11008,2091,11008],"sub_type":"text","text":"报名截止时间","type":"textblock","content":[80],"id":33,"outline_level":-1},{"outline_level":-1,"pos":[3582,10927,3774,10927,3774,11011,3582,11011],"sub_type":"text","text":"难度","type":"textblock","content":[81],"id":36},{"outline_level":-1,"pos":[4435,10929,4724,10929,4724,11010,4435,11010],"sub_type":"text","text":"重要性","type":"textblock","content":[82],"id":35},{"content":[83],"id":37,"outline_level":-1,"pos":[613,11153,974,11153,974,11237,613,11237],"sub_type":"text","text":"竞赛描述","type":"textblock"},{"type":"textblock","content":[84],"id":38,"outline_level":-1,"pos":[601,11383,974,11383,974,11465,601,11465],"sub_type":"text","text":"规划理由"}],"width":6256,"durations":2219.1416015625,"image_id":"","status":"Success"},{"angle":0,"durations":2699.80126953125,"height":15842,"image_id":"","page_id":8,"structured":[{"blocks":[{"id":0,"lines":[0],"pos":[442,351,2621,351,2620,1001,440,1001],"text":"000","type":"image","content":[1]}],"image_url":"https://web-api.textin.com/ocr_image/external/666219bd814fd4c9.jpg","pos":[442,351,2621,351,2620,1001,440,1001],"type":"header"},{"blocks":[{"content":[3],"id":3,"lines":[2],"pos":[4496,704,4737,705,4738,945,4497,945],"text":"","type":"image"}],"image_url":"https://web-api.textin.com/ocr_image/external/cd053920a69d10b9.jpg","pos":[4496,704,4737,705,4738,945,4497,945],"type":"header"},{"blocks":[{"content":[4],"id":2,"outline_level":-1,"pos":[5229,721,5461,721,5461,851,5229,851],"sub_type":"text","text":"夏校","type":"textblock"}],"pos":[5229,721,5461,721,5461,851,5229,851],"type":"header"},{"blocks":[{"id":5,"outline_level":-1,"pos":[4765,835,5477,835,5477,959,4765,959],"sub_type":"text","text":"Summer School","type":"textblock","content":[5]}],"pos":[4765,835,5477,835,5477,959,4765,959],"type":"header"},{"type":"header","blocks":[{"type":"image","content":[7],"id":4,"lines":[6],"pos":[5477,681,5786,681,5786,928,5477,928],"text":"08"}],"image_url":"https://web-api.textin.com/ocr_image/external/ca5c54204c470e29.jpg","pos":[5477,681,5786,681,5786,928,5477,928]},{"id":6,"outline_level":-1,"pos":[464,1176,5771,1176,5771,1657,464,1657],"sub_type":"text","text":"这一部分记录了你已经参加的夏校、以及规划导师与你沟通交流以后一起制定的正在申请中或计划要申请的夏校。参加夏校可以帮助你在专业方向上提前进行大学水平的学习，其中含金量较高的夏校在大学申请时作用有时类似于学术类奖项，能够进一步证明进阶学术实力，并且可以通过夏校争取教授推荐信。另外上过某个大学的夏校也可以证明对该校的入读兴趣，对一些大学来说，这种情况下再选择ED申请该校会有加成。","type":"textblock","content":[8,9,10,11]},{"image_url":"https://web-api.textin.com/ocr_image/external/b5f2d4589454b14a.jpg","lines":[12],"pos":[472,2036,615,2035,613,2171,469,2172],"text":"","type":"image","content":[13],"id":7},{"pos":[603,2058,1160,2058,1160,2153,603,2153],"sub_type":"text_title","text":"计划申请夏校","type":"textblock","content":[14],"id":8,"outline_level":0},{"content":[15],"id":9,"outline_level":0,"pos":[541,2336,1361,2336,1361,2442,541,2442],"sub_type":"text_title","text":"| Summer@Brown","type":"textblock"},{"content":[16],"id":10,"outline_level":0,"pos":[603,2573,990,2573,990,2679,603,2679],"sub_type":"text_title","text":"夏校介绍","type":"textblock"},{"sub_type":"text","text":"Students choose from more than 200 non-creddit courses reflecting the wide range of Brown University' s Open Curriculum that challenge them with new perspectives: https://catalog.precollege.brown.edu/ 2025 Course areas including as: -Biology & Natural Sciences;-Business, Economics & Legal Studies;
